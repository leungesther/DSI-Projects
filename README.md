# General Assembly Data Science Immersive Projects

This repository is a collection of projects done as my course work for **General Assembly Data Science Immersive**:


### Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis
------

Using datasets from SAT and ACT in 2017 and 2018, the aim of this project is to identify ways to improve SAT participation.

This project covers applications of:
1. Basic statistics
2. Basic python programming
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data visualisation


### Project 2: Sale Price Prediction using Ames Housing Data
------

Using Ames housing data with over 70 features, the aim of this project is to build a regression model to predict houe prices.

This project covers applications of:
1. Basic statistics
2. Basic python programming
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data visualisation
5. Regression (including regularization) and model evaluation


### Project 3: Reddit Text Classifier 
------

Using data from Reddit, the aim of this project is to build a text classifier model for a mental health organisation's patient support unit to classify incoming text from social media messagers/ chatbot for depression and bipolar disorder, so that patients will be channelled for appropriate care and treatment.

This project covers applications of:
1. API and webscrapping
2. Exploratory data analysis (including Word Cloud)
3. Natural Langugage Processing
4. Classification (Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB, Support Vector Machine) and model evaluation
5. Pipeline and GridSearch


### Project 4: West Nile Virus Prediction
------

In this project, my teammates and I use the mosquito trap data, weather data and spray data to predict the presence of West Nile Virus in Chicago, United States.

This project covers applications of:
1. Data wrangling
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Handling of imbalanced dataset using SMOTE oversampling
5. Classification & Emsemble techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, GradientBoost and XGBoost)
6. Pipeline & GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning


### Capstone Project: Sentiment Analylsis for NTUC Fairprice Mobile App
------

Using NTUC Fairprice mobile app reviews scraped from Google Play Store and Apple AppStore, this project aims to build a sentiment classifier to identify negative reviews for prompt follow up and service recovery. Topic modelling is also done on the negative reviews to identify customer pain points.

This project covers applications of:
1. API and webscrapping
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Natural Langugage Processing
4. Classification (Classical Machine Learning & Deep Learning)
5. Topic Modelling
