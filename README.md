# General Assembly Data Science Immersive Projects

This repository is a collection of projects done as my course work for **General Assembly Data Science Immersive**:


### Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis
------

Using datasets from SAT and ACT in 2017 and 2018, the aim of this project is to identify ways to improve SAT participation.

This project covers applications of:
1. Basic statistics
2. Basic python programming
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data visualisation


### Project 2: Sale Price Prediction using Ames Housing Data
------

Using Ames housing data with over 70 features, the aim of this project is to build a regression model to predict houe prices.

This project covers applications of:
1. Basic statistics
2. Basic python programming
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data visualisation
5. Regression (including regularization) and model evaluation


### Project 3: Reddit Text Classifier 
------

Using data from Reddit, the aim of this project is to build a text classifier model for a mental health organisation's patient support unit to classify incoming text from social media messagers/ chatbot for depression and bipolar disorder, so that patients will be channelled for appropriate care and treatment.

This project covers applications of:
1. API and webscrapping
2. Exploratory data analysis (including Word Cloud)
3. Natural Langugage Processing
4. Classification (Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB, Support Vector Machine) and model evaluation
5. Pipeline and GridSearch
