0,depression,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
1,depression,"Regular check-in post, plus a warning and a request about an obnoxious new PM bot. Details inside.","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.

*************

Looks like we've got someone who's set up a bot to PM a high volume of users here automatically.  This is, as the other sticky post explains, a toxic and stupid behaviour.  The text of the PMs we know about is identical, and copied below.

&gt; I'm sending you so much love and positivity today. I pray that whatever suffering you are going through comes to an end. I know you can make it through this depression and into the light, because I've been there and I believe in you! I pray that all of the hurt you are going through comes to an end. I pray that the universe makes it easy for you to let go of any resentments and fear, so that you can live your life to the fullest and with all of the love and authenticity you have. I know you can do this, because you deserve to be happy and heal. I believe in you, and I know you can make it through!

&gt; Please take care, and don't forget to do something really good for yourself today. Take it one day at a time. Eventually it's all going to be OK, I promise!.

There are so many rule violations and toxic positivity in this that we're honestly not sure if it's serious or satire, but either way this is subverting our mission as a community for meaningful, serious peer support.  

The username they're currently using is /u/reachingout_103, but someone with this much contempt for both our community policies and best practices in mental health support is liable to make multiple alts to relieve whatever twisted psychological itch they're trying to scratch with this ridiculous behaviour.  

Please report all unsolicited PMs you get after you post or comment here, especially those from this user or those similar to the one quoted above.

**Edit:**  To report PMs

 * On desktop, there's a ""report"" link under the message, or you can paste the permalink into the box at /r/reddit.com/report

 * In the official mobile apps, tap the 3-vertical-dot menu at the top right of each message in your PM *list* (i.e. before you go into the full message) to pop up the report and block user functions.  

 * If you're using an unofficial app, you'll need to consult its documentation, since the UIs vary a great deal."
2,depression,Did your anxiety give you depression or am I just fucked.,My anxiety makes me care too much until I don’t care at all and I fluctuate between the two. How can I stop this? Depression is quickly starting to win the battle against me😶
3,depression,I should have been aborted,"No talent. No brains. No looks. Can’t sing. Can’t study. Hate school. Hate life. Hate jobs. Hate capitalism.
Fuck this shit. Fuck this SHIT. FUCK THIS SHITTTTTTT!!!!"
4,depression,I want to kill myself and the thoughts are only getting stronger every day.,"I am 20F. I’m depressed more than you can imagine. I’m newly on medication and waiting for it to all kick In is so exhausting. 

I keep imagining bridges. Jumping from a bridge. I feel like I have to. I feel like I need to and I feel like I will. Someone try to talk me away from doing this because i can’t stop the thoughts and voices."
5,depression,Starting new job Monday after 9 months unemployed. Totally depressed but I have to go in and somehow fake it.,"How do you guys go to work, with the feeling of nothingness on the inside? How do you fake a smile or fake a laugh. My mind would like to sit in a dark room for years. But life goes on and I have to pay my bills. 

How do I fake it at work. How do I even care enough to try. This is really hard. Being around people having to fake it."
6,depression,Lost my last remaining friend,"We knew eachother for about 8 years now. I never met her inrl but we always played games together and had fun. Anyways, few months ago she got a boyfriend. She just been all into him and we just stopped playing together. She plays with he plays now. I don't mind it,I'm happy she found someone but dang at least text me back..something 😥. Before that she found a ""cool"" group of gaming friends and she tried to get me to join their party to talk (playstation partychat) but I couldn't. I have really bad social anxiety so meeting new people, even if it's online still fucks me up. Always have. 

I don't blame her honestly. She just got done with college last year and has a good job now. We're not teenagers anymore. I have nothing, I dropped out of school due to my depression and anxiety, could not handle it anymore. I prepared myself for this moment when she'll eventually get bored of me. I wish her well. Now I'm just alone, this post is all over the place but I just wanted to vent to someone."
7,depression,"The more you indulge in sadness, the harder it is to stop","I find it really difficult to block out negative thoughts. Theres almost some sort of euphoria I get from indulging in them, despite how awful they make me feel. Is this common? Is there a name for this? Once I've started thinking negatively, its like it just carries me away and quickly becomes uncontrollable. The best coping method I've found is to try and stop the negative thoughts before they happen, but that's been getting harder and harder lately. I try to distract myself so that self-destructive ideas don't get the chance to form, but whenever I start getting really stressed and I can't just retreat into my shell, its like a rainstorm starts pouring down inside me."
8,depression,"Dealing with Loss, can't move on","In 2012, i lost my 13 year old son, he was my only child. Ever since, I am filled with sadness, sorrow, hopelessness. I can't move on from it. I'm can't feel joy, happiness, or anything except sadness. I can't seem to recover from this loss. I've seen a psychiatrist, tried medication, but nothing has helped. I feel guilty if i ever laugh at something funny on TV or the internet. When my son died, i i died too. It's been 8 years. Does anyone have any advice, anyone whose experienced the same loss, can anyone help me?"
9,depression,Wish I didn’t exist,No friends no SO no job no license no car no hobbies other than video games and my health is failing me all i do is wake up play video games then sleep i have no direction or purpose in life there’s nothing for me to look forward to its the same shit day in and day out im not living at all im just here existing. Anyways thanks for reading i needed to vent cause i got nobody to talk to about this stuff and probably never will. Hope you all have a good day.
10,depression,"Dear some mentally well people, stop trying to make my mental health political.","I’ve had many people tell me the reason I’m depressed is simply capitalism, or something similar. They try to manipulate me into believing that if I fight for their ideology I won’t have to go through a cycle of things I don’t want to do and that under their ideology my trauma wouldn’t have happened. I don’t know how many people this has happened to, but, I get this too often. It’s like people don’t realize that under any economic system, I would still have to do everything that makes healing hard and everything that tore me apart still would’ve happened. Life being a nightmare isn’t just capitalist, socialist, or communist. They all allow suffering. Please stop trying to use me to push your ideology. It just hurts me more."
11,depression,I think about dying every day and it's become so casual,"Just as the title suggest. I think about dying so much, that my subconscious dreams about it when im daydreaming or just letting random thoughts go through my head. 

I saw an article today in fb. It was an old article, but it showed this futuristic angled tanning bed looking pod and the title said ""Hawaii legalizes assisted suicide"". Of course I immediately opened the article. They described how doctors could literally prescribe death as a medical procedure and how these pods, you basically get in one, hold down the button for 30 seconds to make sure that you want to die, and then it'll play a cartoon or something on a TV screen inside the pod and over 15 or so minutes it releases gasses into the pod that put you into a deep sleep that you dont wake up from. 

I literally smiled reading that article because I thought wow that sounds amazing. I thought about how casually I would just hop in one if these were readily available. Like I dont even have hopes anymore I've just accepted that the worst possible outcome in any scenario is my most likely outcome. I would literally schedule an appointment for one of those pods and fly to Hawaii tomorrow if I thought for a second they'd let a depressed non terminal patient use one. Even though I know for certain that they wouldn't. 

I thought about that pretty much all day. How I wish suicide was as casual in society as it is in my head. How I wish I was allowed to give up. How I wish I wouldn't be called a coward for not wanting to live and how I wish that no one would miss me so I could just... check out in a cozy little pod with an episode of SpongeBob playing or something. 

Back to my original point, suicide has become a huge part of my every day thinking. And I even joke about it casually to friends and family even though I'm serious. I just wish it could be as casual as going on vacation and never returning... I don't wanna be here anymore. And I haven't for a long time. 

I'm sure no one will make It to the end of this rant, but if you do thanks, and I hope you can't relate to the feeling..."
12,depression,is it common that you get worse at things (specifically video games) when you are depressed?,"The only thing I do is sit in my room all day and video games (mainly league of legends) are the only things that made me happy, but the last couple of months I have played so poorly that it completely took away my motivation to even play video games. now I just lay in my bed all day and read twitter or just sleep."
13,depression,"I swear to god if I hear ""don't beat yourself up"" or ""one day/step at a time"" or ""recovery isn't a strait path"" or ""it's not your fault"" one more time I'm going to explode.","I (30m) hate talking about my depression because I'm sick of how everyone always says one if not all of these things in response. Today I was talking to a friend about how I'm broke, living with my parents post-suicide-attempt, piles of debt, shitty car, blah blah blah. A while ago we had talked about getting an apartment together in the next year or so, and I told him today that he didn't have to wait for me to get better to find a new place b/c I just don't see it happening in that time frame at this rate. And I know he just wanted to show compassion and be a good friend but I've just heard it all too many times now. I just don't believe anyone anymore. Everyone sounds the same. Same words, same tone, same look on their face. And I try to not let them see me roll my eyes. I just say thanks and we move on. But I'm tired of pretending to appreciate people trying to be supportive. They just say those things because they're uncomfortable hearing about how I feel. They say things like ""don't think like that"" because they don't want to hear me talk about it. So I don't because I don't want to make them uncomfortable or think I might be planning something. ""Yes thank you for reminding me that my mode of thinking is all wrong!"" I think to myself. Fuck it.

Really just had to get that off my chest. Thank you."
14,depression,Today is my 1 year anniversary after attempting suicide,"A year ago, I attempted suicide. I was put in the hospital the following day, and I don't remember anything from it.

I survived.

I've grown and learned more than I can imagine within this year. I've battled hard times, and I've won.

I'm proud to be alive. I've conquered it.

Depression doesn't always win.

Keep on going."
15,depression,"sometimes i dont feel like i belong , i dont feel human",sometimes the amount of dissatisfaction with myself makes me feel like i dont belong like im not human thats why i find such a difference between me and literally everyone but im not suicidal btw
16,depression,25 and I feel like my life is over,"I feel like I fucked everything up. every decision I make is the wrong one. fucked up my finances, my credit, regret my degree, dead end job, and bf that's 28 and still doesnt know what they want to do. everyone's out buying houses and I cant even get a job in my field. I've accomplished nothing. I never feel like I'm working hard enough and I feel so beaten to the ground."
17,depression,Nothing Brings Me Joy Anymore,"As a matter of fact, I am practically numb to everything around me now. No happiness, pain, guilt, anger, sadness, anxiety. There is nothing present almost everyday.

And you know what makes it worse? I have a ton of things in my life to be grateful for. Supportive family, good relationship, close friends and active social life, pretty good job. Now I rarely want to leave the house unless I’m running errands. I can’t even recall the last time I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with anyone leisurely, not even my significant other nor actually feeling bad if i did something wrong. Smiling from cheek to cheek is close to nonexistent, at least authentically. Having any sort of negative feelings almost seems like a past time. Big promotion? okay. Friend is mad I clearly blew her off? okay. Gaining a few pounds? okay. Traveling somewhere exotic? okay

I almost don’t even know if I have the capacity to feel anything anymore whether it be positive or negative.

The autopilot won’t turn off"
18,depression,Graduating in 2020 is rough,"In March of 2019 I accepted an internship to a very prestigious company that deals with anything from the production of a very popular artist's tour to permanent installation at a theme park such as Disney World/Land. During my short internship from May-August I quickly realized that this was the industry that I wanted to work in for the rest of my life. While working there it was drilled into my head that I (among 24 interns) were selected from about 1000 applicants, and we were pretty much guaranteed full-time positions once we graduated. In September of 2019 I was offered my dream job and I had pretty much stopped looking for other employment opportunities. I was lucky to go nearly my entire senior year of college without having having to worry about finding a job after graduating. However, in March 2020 I received a call telling me that my position offered nearly 6 months ago was no longer available due to the current epidemic. I was assured that when things settled down that I would be re-offered the same position. I reached out a few months after that and they basically told me that company was no longer hiring any new employees. I responded saying that I knew things were rough during the epidemic and I understood why they couldn't take on new employees, but regardless I was pretty disappointed. I let them know that when things returned to normal I was open to receiving another offer and that I would stay in touch. Since then I have been applying to nearly every job matching my major, but there just isn't any entry level positions available at the time. I feel like I have fallen from the peak to the bottom of the valley. I have applied to nearly 200 other engineering positions and have only received a response from a few stating that they were looking for applicants with more experience. I am totally demoralized from applying to more jobs and the pressure from my parents is at an all time high because they figure that companies should be normalizing by now and looking for new hires. I have got no idea what my future looks like."
19,depression,I wish I wasn’t so weak and soft . I wish I was resilient like other people are. Sorry to vent but I had to tell someone anonymous,"How are people so strong? I never understood how they could handle life without falling apart . How they can live life fearlessly and freely while I live cautiously always afraid that I will fuck up in a gross disgusting way. People just accept themselves like it’s easy instead of mollifying every single flaw under a microscope. I don’t know why I let small things get to me , like not doing something perfectly defines every failure l will make . I’m scared of disappointing my parents and authority figures so I make myself small just so they can think I’m a good little daughter . I never oppose them because they love me but I don’t feel like my own person and I can’t even be independent because I don’t have the money or resources to be independent . I’m afraid i will never bring something to the table and if I do bring something that it’s something empty and non nourishing like white bread . And I hate how much I wish I could have independence to make my own mistakes. I hate that I have a body and that other people perceive it. I hate how I try to be worthy to others to the point I see nothing in myself. The person I’ve always wanted to impress was myself but she’s implacable . Lastly , I’m tired of nothing ever changing , staying alive in this half existence like I’m a ghost watching everyone live  from some liminal space where nothing is real . I’m just afraid . That’s what it boils down to."
20,depression,How do I conquer my demons if I can’t even bring myself to love myself?,My past is filled with regrets and mistakes that I frankly cannot forgive myself for. My depression has built a wall around my inner demons that is preventing me from forgiving myself.

Betrayed. Was cheated on by someone I gave all my heart to and whom I thought love me completely as well.
This much pain is too great to handle. 2 Years wasn’t long but not on the short side either.
I guess I was a fool to trust someone like her to begin with when I heard about her past relationships.
She probably still thinks I don’t know she cheated, blamed everything on me, and is happy right now.
I’m just suffering in self-blame, lost of myself, and the feeling of betrayal.
I don’t know if I can go on another day like this...

24,depression,A 22 year old who doesn't know what to so,"I am a 22 year old male from India. My depression started when I was 15 years old when someone close to me died at that time i didn't understand depression I thought I was only sad but slowly two more people close to me passed away and as the depression went deeper. I started seeing the worst in everyone and mostly in people from my family. They were really the worst humans I had ever seen as a kid I thought the were the peole I would like to be when I grow up.
These all and a bunch of backstabbing friends led to more depressed thoughts which eventually made me suicidal but then I seeked help it did help somewhat but I couldn't afford the treatment as I am a student so I opened up to my parents about it they did help me in start but then they are not helping me financially for treatment and since the pandemic I lost my part time job I am stuck with them I was a really intelligent kid before depression but now I feel really dumb I am jealous of people with their happy life and achieving things and here I am struggling to be alive so that when I die no one feels guilty.
I feel that I should leave my friends and family behind to reboot my life just me I really think that will help but I am not getting any jobs to do that but I am still trying hopefully I'll get out of this pit and find a reason to live."

27,depression,My Misdiagnosis Almost Killed Me,"tl;dr: Always stand up for yourself when you know your medication is not right. I didn't, and I almost killed myself.

&amp;#x200B;

In July, I received a new diagnosis from my second psychiatrist. It turned out I was on the bipolar spectrum, but I was so barely on it that no one noticed. My depressive symptoms were so aggressive, and my hypomania (if you could even call it that) just looked like I was very productive.

The only way we know for sure is because the new medication I was put on started giving me damaging hypomania symptoms. I told my psychiatrist I randomly was able to stay up for days at a time, and we knew.

My first psychiatrist didn't catch it. In fact, he dismissed it. My therapist at the time almost caught it. After I told her that some days I only need 3 hours of sleep but other days I felt like I needed 12, she suspected I could be bipolar. However, she admitted that she didn't feel qualified to diagnose something like that and told me to bring it up with my psychiatrist. I brought it up with him, and he almost immediately shrugged it off.

For months, I was being treated with medications that could have never helped me. (I don't know why some medications can treat depression but not bipolar's depressive symptoms. It's so weird.) The meds I was on were either doing nothing or making me worse.

My first psychiatrist told me I had severe depression and treatments began. First, I was on Lexapro. I told my psychiatrist that I didn't feel any better, if not worse. Then it was Prozac. Still nothing. Still a possible worse.

Next was Lamictal. Lamictal is a mood stabilizer.

I think he was a bit frustrated that none of the more traditional SSRIs were helping me, so he decided to go down an alternative route. He told me that Lamictal, though a mood stabilizer, was known to help depression.

Looking back, now knowing I'm on the bipolar spectrum, I wonder what damage it was doing to me. I was already so depressed, and I have to assume taking only a mood stabilizer dragged me even further down.

I'd never felt so low. Suicidal thoughts were banging their fists in my head. I felt sadness manifest itself as physical pain.

I told my psychiatrist that I felt horrible.

He told me I was still adjusting.

He doubled my dosage.

I don't know why he did it. Maybe he really thought sticking through with it would help me. Maybe because I'm young and girl he didn't take me seriously. Maybe he was irritated that I was switching so much. I don't know.

A week later I tried to kill myself. I took myself to the ER before I could take enough pills.

I spent a few months after that scared to go back and try a new psychiatrist with meds.

But I did it. I'm here now.

I want to share my story because I never want this to happen to anyone else. When he told me he was doubling my dosage, I should've started screaming and crying and doing whatever it took to make him listen to me. I should've just not taken the pills. I should've found a new psychiatrist the moment he didn't listen to me.

But I didn't want to cause a scene. But I *wanted* to be ""still adjusting"" and for these pills to be the one to work. But I was so worn out I don't think I had the energy to find a new one.

Still, no matter how many arguments I had against it, I wish someone had told me how important it is to stand up for yourself. To even medical professionals when you know they're wrong.

So, this is me. Telling you."
28,depression,i’m so close to giving up,"hi. i’m 16 (F) and i’ve been battling w depressions for the past two years. i’ve recently been put onto medication but i’m guessing due to my exam stress that is happening currently it doesn’t seem to have any effect on me. i used to be smart, i used to study effectively and i was able to achieve the grades that i wanted. but now, i can’t. not to mention my unhealthy coping mechanism is to harm myself. 

i cant study effectively, my memory sucks and my thinking has slowed down, i can’t concentrate and i can’t do anything to help. my major exams are drawing near and as the days go by i can’t help but feel that it’s hopeless, impossible in fact. every time someone tells me to imagine my future, my success and achieving my goals, all i can see is a grey area because i can’t see myself making it past this year. i’m so close to giving up, i’m already trying to plan the day where i leave this world. 

nothing seems to make me feel better. i have nothing to offer to this world. no talent, no skill. i wouldn’t be able to survive even if i were to live on, so why bother? 

sorry. i just needed a place to vent."
29,depression,"Job making depression worse, at the end of the day my mind is so overwhelmed I feel insane",I feel like I'm gonna lose my job. I work in a grocery store as an opener or closer but every day I work I do well the first 4-5 hours and lose my patience severely. My job is quite laborious and we're understaffed so I am being put through the ringer. Everyone at my workplace already knows me as q weird introverted dude because I care so much about what others think. But I literally get to the point at night where I just throw shit around and smash things because I'm so pissed at my job. I will literally self destruct and tell people I'm retarded or autistic because I hate myself so much. I want pity.
30,depression,Trying to stay positive but it’s hard.,"I’ll start off by saying I’m currently on medication and it’s helping a bit but still not great. 

I’m 9 months sober tomorrow. It’s been really tough, especially lately. I lost my girlfriend to suicide in January and can’t stop thinking about her and having bad dreams about the morning I found her. 

I just got a call from my brothers girlfriend saying that he is having a mental breakdown and mentioned suicide a few times. My parents rushed over there now and told me not to come because he is really drunk and it wouldn’t be a good place for me. 

It’s just a lot. There doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel. :("
31,depression,Nobody really cares,"Have you ever poured out your heart to someone about how you feel or about your depression and they reply to it with “what am I suppose to say to that?”

33,depression,Since I opened up about feeling depressed I feel like my friend only talks to me out of pity,"Around a month ago I opened up to an online friend about feeling depressed, I'm really glad that I did it because she was really supportive and gave me some great advice.

However, I've noticed that ever since this she talks to me a lot more and always makes sure to call me ""pal"". 

We mainly talk in a private discord server (its her server as she is a YouTuber) but I've noticed that if I ever put a message in the server she always makes sure to respond (even though there are 20 other members in the server).

We talked a lot before I told her how I was feeling but we talk significantly more now.

I'm obviously really appreciative that she is taking time out of their day to talk to me, but sometimes I feel like she is only talking to me because she feels bad for me, I don't want her to feel forced to talk me, I dont want to be a burden on her life and I dont want to bring her down."
34,depression,Stuck in the loop of feeling like I can’t keep up with everyone else around me,"Feeling too many things at once. Feeling guilt for not being able to be grateful for what I have, feeling embarrassed and ashamed for not knowing what I want to do with my life. Feeling like the world is passing me by so quickly, even when I can logically see that we’re in a pandemic and everyone is doing it tough right now. 
I don’t feel strong enough to keep up with the world. I don’t feel competent enough to advance career wise, especially when I don’t know what career I want to be in. Then you have to work in something that financially keeps you stable. I just feel like life is a lot and it seems really hard, I don’t know how everyone else seems to handle it. Sorry for the word vomit."
35,depression,Only thing stopping me from ending it - fear.,"I'm afraid of pain, I'm afraid of what's next - what happens after you die. Other than that nothing is stopping me from doing it. There's nothing in my life to live for, to try any more or to wait for.

Actually I don't have a single excuse to continue but there are millions to end it."
36,depression,Can iron deficiency and a low blood count cause anxiety/depression in women?,Just wondering about this because I had my period since I was 10 and it was at 10 when my anxiety seemed to begin. The merry go round was too terrifying for me all the motion of up and going around and losing control made me cry and I'd yell for the ride to stop. Being a loner (no family my age to play with and too studious/shy/and a bookworm/nerd) made it worse. However i've been iron deficient for a long time. Taking those iron pills are the worst. I'm in my late 30's now and still iron deficient. I do get clotting during my period in the first few days but it's light the next few days.

I haven't given up yet, but I feel so sad and pathetic right now, overanalyzing and spending way too much time in my head. I'm clueless how to go on, I feel so stuck right now. Thanks for listening, whoever reads this."
39,depression,I was dumped for the third time and again it 'Was not your fault'.,"Since I was 18 I've been in serious relationships only. I'm ugly and anti-social and do not know how to talk to people especially girls. I do my best online and after a year of searching and rejection do I find one who likes me and can tolerate me. I've have a history of depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts since I was a boy.  

My parents abandoned me and I was raped by a priest. I was bullied in school for having a fairer skin than others and the inability to speak Hindi. I had no friends all my life and I still don't. I clung on to relationships as a lifeboat. I've been in three and all ended with them dumping me. I noticed a pattern that I was the 'best guy they ever met and any girl would be lucky to have me'. But, not them.

And then they left. 8 years in school, 2 years after that and then 4 years now. I always find myself at the starting point then work my way up to the top. Only to find this is another starting point again. I have nothing left. I need someone to hold who can tell me I mean something because that was the one thing I was never given as a child. I never felt needed or loved so now I cling on to anyone who just talks nicely and I'm willing to pour it all out for them. I have a job, I make okay money but none of that even matters. I've been suicidal for so long why do I even try anymore."

41,depression,Lost time,"People say that they’re having a fight with depression. Like depression is an enemy you can fight head on; like reminding me that people care about me will arm me for war. I don’t fight my depression. 

I’ve known that it was there for a long time. Maybe I’ve always known. Like something I kept in my bottom drawer, under my socks. If I don’t look at it I can be like everyone else. Until one day someone came along and dumped my depression out on the floor for all to see.

Now I wear my depression like armor. Because I can’t get hurt if I don’t feel. My depression is my spacesuit, with no tether. I float through what’s become of my life, with no way back to what I once was. 

Because I remember. I remember when I was happy. I remember what I was before I was happy. I was hopeful. Now I’m not. Now I just want to be happy again. But not a new happy, the old happy. The happy I felt when I realized what I wanted in life, and that I was there. 

Then my drawer got flipped over. There is no hope, because how can you hope for time to turn back? When you know it can’t happen, that IT WILL NEVER BE again. 

I don’t have a fight with depression. I have a fight with time. Time is my enemy. 

Depression is just me losing, and I hope I don’t wake up. 

Maybe now I can sleep, wake up and pretend I’m ok for another day, until tomorrow night when I realize I’ve been defeated another day. 

This isn’t poetry, this is thought vomit.

Thanks for reading. I’m just writing what I feel, and seeing if it helps at all. Maybe seeing it on a public forum might help?"

I had spent 2 hours before my shift in the bathroom throwing up. My coworker showed up to check on me, asked how I was and even though I said I was still really sick, they just said ""cool"" and after a cigarette they left. I have helped my coworkers multiple time and every single time I ask they say no. I'm still at work and just needed to vent, I already cried once in the bathroom. I've been struggling like hell recently and I've been trying my best not to self harm or worse, because I can't leave my wife to live without me. I'm just so tired and worn thin in this town.

I thought to myself years ago, “hey why don’t I try to make something of myself”. That was the biggest fucking joke ever. I couldn’t even get into the Ph.D. program that I tried so hard to get into. I contribute nothing of value. I’m just an emotional black hole that sucks the joy and light out of anything that is unfortunate enough to cross my path. I fucking hate myself so much."

46,depression,Really really lonely,"I feel so alone. I recently moved halfway across the country (US) to volunteer through Americorps. I left behind family and friends and belongings to come live with my aunt and work for her. At the same time that I was accepted, she got a new job very far away. She is still letting me live in her house, but now I live here alone. 

I know almost no one except coworkers. I work part time at a fast food restaurant because obviously volunteering pays very little. I’ve met some nice people, but none of them care about me on more than a work level. I’m even having a few people over tomorrow to try to prove to myself that I can make friends. I’m very social, so I enjoy doing things like this, but I’m putting so much pressure on myself for it to go perfectly that I can barely look forward to it. 

There is no one within hundreds of miles that cares about me more than just whether I show up for work on Monday. I feel so alone and unimportant. I’ve been trying to keep in touch with my friends and family, but it’s difficult, especially because I can’t bring myself to tell them how I’m actually feeling. I don’t want them to feel like they need to do more to support me because then I would be a burden. I definitely don’t want them to think I’ve made a mistake by moving here because then I would be a failure. 

I tried to call my dad a few minutes ago to tell him how I’m feeling. He’s the one person in my life who I can trust to be logical and positive at the same time and make me feel better. It’s 1am for him so of course he didn’t answer. I can’t help but think about when I could’ve just walked downstairs and woken him up. This is my first time living further than a 30 minute drive from my parents and the house I grew up in.

I’ve been feeling so bad lately I’ve been thinking about suicide. I wonder how long it would take for anyone to even know I was gone. My boss would notice when I don’t show up for work, but he would probably think I was sick or something. All of my friends and family are doing fine without me already, it’s like I’m already dead."

I'm mentally retired and want to finally accept the fact that I can't progress anymore. I won't feel happy again, maybe for a brief moment but generally speaking I'm exhausted and sad all the time and that's just how it is and I'm now accepting that.

50,depression,"I got drunk, and did something I really regret.","So, the other night I was hanging out with my two friends 'A' and 'K' (they're siblings), and we were planning to get really high, and really drunk. I am newly 15, and it wouldn't be the first time that I've smoked, or drank. 

That night was the first time I'd ever been drunk, I'd only ever been tipsy. I guess I was cross-faded because I smoked so much too, but I was really having a good time. I hadn't felt so happy in a really long time. At around midnight, 'A' left to the park to go walk with one of her friends back to the house.  'K' stayed back with me, and at this point I was really out of it, and so was 'K'. We were both still really awake, but everything was blurry. I remember 'K' started complimenting the way I look, and it made me a little uncomfortable, so I would just give the occasional 'thank you'. I don't even remember how, but the next thing I know was that 'K' was on top of me, pinning me to the floor. Now, I will say that for the past few years, I figured that I am sure  I'm asexual and aromantic, and 'K' was well aware of that. In this moment, I was barely able to understand what was going on. 'K' is 17, soon to be 18, and I would never do anything to hurt them, so I just kind of let it happen. I wasn't too capable of movement, and everything was so blurry, I remember 'K' kept trying to put their hand down my pants, I kept telling them 'no' because I was extremely uncomfortable with the whole situation. 'K' was practically smothering me, and they kept french kissing me. I didn't really say anything. At some point, 'K' put my hand down their pants, and I don't remember exactly what happened. 'K' was completely naked at this point, and kept asking for oral. I said I didn't wan to, but they kept insisting. I was able to leave for a moment because I said I needed water. when I came back down, 'K' was on the bathroom floor throwing up. I got them into the shower, and they kept trying to pull me in, saying that we should have sex. Luckily 'A' came home with our friend, and 'A' was able to take care of 'K', and put them to bed. I drank and smoked a lot after that. When I told 'A' what happened, all they did was laugh, and say 'sorry you didn't enjoy it'.

This isn't the first time 'K' has pulled something like this, I have woken up in the middle of the night before to them rubbing their hands all over me gentil area. 

It's been maybe 15+ hours since that, and it's getting really hard to not self harm. That's the only way I know how to cope, and I've been taken advantage of many times in my life, and it's hard to not hate myself having to live with this. I just want to release this pain, and I don't understand why this keeps happening to me. I just feel so alone, because I can't really tell anyone I know. I just want it to stop."

Seeking: Advice


Hey first time posting here. Please be kind.

I’ve been going through some bouts of depression lately and started having minor suicidal thoughts. Not serious ones where I’m think of how to end my life but mainly just thoughts about what it would be like if I wasn’t here anymore. The main thing that’s holding me down is not wanting to make my family and partner sad. 

I’ve been meaning to go into therapy and I’ve gone through therapy before thanks to my school and work funding for some sessions. My past therapy sessions mainly helped me get through when my mom was abusing my dad and they were constantly fighting. These sessions definitely helped me better understand that what’s happening between them is not my fault and I learned to set boundaries better.

I also noted in my previous sessions about how I was feeling anxiety and depressed but I haven’t been fully diagnosed for it. My last therapist only gave me general advice for it and it was understandable because she specialized in family/marriage relations. But ever since then, I’ve been slowly feeling more and more depressed. COVID-19 didn’t help at all and made me feel me more isolated, anxious, and depressed. It also didn’t help that I wasn’t able to see my partner due to housing arrangement. After about a month or two since shelter in place, I started having suicidal thoughts. Thoughts of not feeling like I belonged here anymore. But after breaking off from the housing agreement, I was able to be with my partner again and I didn’t have these thoughts anymore. Only a few moments of feeling depressed.

After some circumstances from work, I decided to leave the program to come back home to my family and decided to use this time to look for other career and grad school opportunities. Because of this decision, I had to move away from my partner and we’re about 7 hours away from each other now. My partner and I have been together for 3 and half years now and the bulk of it is long distance so we’re pretty good at making things work. However now that I’m back home, I’m alone most of the time because my family has work and we don’t really do much stuff with each other. 

For the past few weeks, my suicidal thoughts have been coming back again and I want to go into therapy but it’s usually expensive and my last therapist wasn’t a great fit. Do any of you have any recommendations on online therapy that isn’t pricey and had a good experience with? 

I fear that if I were to open up to a therapist for thinking about suicide that they’ll flag it and send me to a mental facility. I know it’s protocol that they need to report it but I don’t want to go to a mental facility because of all the bad stories I’ve heard about. Do you have any advice about how I can go about this? I want to get help but I feel so lost. 

I have thought about medication but I want to do it as a last resort. I don’t currently have health insurance but I’ll be under my mom’s insurance soon but she’s super traditional and doesn’t recognize mental health at all."
56,depression,I don’t see a point,"I don’t see a point in fighting this anymore. I feel like I’m such a burden. I shower at least 7x a day and lay in there for as long as I can (yes, lying down in the shower) it’s the closest to death I can get to without actually dying. I don’t want to hurt my loved ones, but I also don’t know how much longer I can fight this."
57,depression,Whats the point,Cant really find a reason to get out of bed anymore these days
58,depression,is self harming ever a side effect of anti depressants,"i rarely used to self harm but for the past 4 days i’ve been doing it everyday, i got put on anti depressants a week or so ago could that have anything to do with it?"
59,depression,I do(nt) want to end it,Yes I'm talking about my life. I(22M) lost everything. And I'm having extreme suicidal thoughts. I lost my 19 year old brother earlier this year and yesterday I lost the love of my life. Nobody wants me. I dont want me. I need help.. Thanks for tuning in.
60,depression,What helps you manage your depression?,"For me, I must be consistent in taking my 10 mg of Lexapro daily, &amp; must exercise daily. If I slack off on exercise, my mood instantly dips. If I skip even a day of my medications, I will pay a few days later with severe crying spells &amp; an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. I must avoid being sleep deprived, I need at least 7 hours a night. Confiding in my sister helps immensely, she's my biggest protective factor. She's so understanding, &amp; because she's a GP, she's familiar with depression in a clinical setting, &amp; tools of CBT.

I know these may seem standard &amp; universal, but I think it'll still be enlightening for us to share what has helped us individually, as people with depression :)"
61,depression,I forgot how happiness feels like.,"I wish I was loved, I wish I wasn't so alone, I wish I can look forward to another day and waking up in the morning. I wish I can remember how it felt to be happy, it was so so long ago that I forgot how it feels."
62,depression,Depression since a kid and daily suicidal thoughts.,"Idk how to begin this. It’s my first post here, I’ve browsed this sub for years every now and then. I don’t think anyone cares, but I just need to let some things out before I end up killing myself. 

I’m 26, I keep telling myself I’ll wait and see if things get better and see how things pan out. Only for things to get worse. I often feel like if I killed myself years ago it would’ve just been better that way. 

Nothing is fun anymore. I’ve tried antidepressants, anything affecting my serotonin makes me walk around looking for trees to hang myself on. “Oh that’s a pretty tree, maybe that would be a nice place to die”. I’m on Wellbutrin now, it does give me energy but doesn’t stop the depression. 
I don’t do any drugs, I’ve realized all the drugs I’ve done make things worse. I’ve been addicted to benzos (quit), opiates(quit) and used weed for a while to keep the pain away. Stopped a few months ago. 

Everything is so empty, video games, walking around outdoors, tv, music. My ex left me, the only person I’ve loved, told me I had too many problems and she’s right. She told me she was happier after we broke up so that’s good. I have friends but they don’t feel close. If I ever bring up anything negative they tell me “you shouldn’t be so negative” or “I like focusing on positive things”. I stay in solitude every day. 

I go to therapy every month. It doesn’t help, they give me some goals or a question to work on usually. Like the last one was “what is happiness to you?” I thought about it for a month. Idk, idk what happiness is. The only time I think I felt happy was when I was with someone I love, and when they understood me. But she told me it was all an act, so I guess I wasn’t really happy. 

I work full time, so I can distract myself. The pain on my body feels nice. I go to the gym at least 4 times a week for the endorphins. It’s not really helping my depression though. I’m having a problem with my eyelid, keeps swelling up sometimes, giving me ptosis. Makes me look kinda creepy. I’m kind of hoping it’s a cancer tumor so I can die without feeling bad for my mom. My brother died a few years ago when I was in prison for possessing weed and lsd. I heard his last words over the phone. 

Every day is just the same thing. There’s nothing I look forward to. I like getting tattoos, the pain makes me feel alive. Other than that, I feel alone. Like I’m in limbo. I see happy people/couples, and think that must be nice good for them. Makes me feel like dying a little more though. I just want to disappear from everyone’s life, i think everyone would be happier that way. And I wouldn’t be suffering anymore. Seems like a win win."
63,depression,I've been hurt too much,"Every time I was supposed to be supported, I was literally spat on and betrayed. Everyone in my life who was supposed to be better, wasn't. My dad, who was the best dad ever according to my misogynistic uncles and cousin because he didn't verbally abuse me after being raped like they did, who was honestly the only person to ever really care about me, even him, was also a psychotic little shit at the end of the day who strangled me for not drinking as much water as he wanted. He was the best fucking person in my life, and he fucking strangled me when I was 14 or 15 years old.

I hate my life. Normal people don't have to say ""yeah he strangled me, BUT he still really loved me and he was the best father ever"". No. No. I don't want to do that shit.

I don't care if he felt love for me. That's not good enough. No one in my life has ever been fucking good enough. They haven't been fucking human."
64,depression,Should you consider yourself depressed without a diagnosis?,"Context. I'm a teenager who, on the outside, seems fairly stable. I'm near the top of my graduating class, I'm dual enrolled in highschool and community college, I'm a learning musician, writer, and programmer.

For the past two or so years I've been struggling with a lot of things. Feelings of uselessness, feelings that I may as well not exist, hating myself, who I am, who created me, what I might become. I have a small amount of friends but no real support or friend circle to involve myself with. Quarantine, unlike most people, has not changed my life whatsoever. In fact, it allowed me to pass a class with a better grade because I was able to work from home. I have little to no energy, I hate going out and doing anything away from home, and being around others for longer than a day or two tires me out and leaves me sulking for a day or two. My only motivation is to make sure I meet the expectations of my family and friends, and the obligations I've made that would just lead to an even more hellish life if I were to shatter them.

Further beyond that, I've contemplated the scenario of taking my own life and the repercussions of it. I won't say I've ever tried or that I really would. But just the thought of it; if I died, I wouldn't really leave a lasting impact. Some kid from a nowhere town with parents who experience their own bad medical issues, a small amount of friends and connections. It really wouldn't be that big of a deal.

So, that's a lot of rambling that isn't related to the title, but I'm getting to it.
So, I'm just wondering, between all of the negative thoughts, contemplation of death, that sounds like what I hear a lot from people with depression, but at the same time the thought of self diagnosis sounds wrong? I'd never ask to see a therapist or psychologist about that, it's a total waste of time, I wouldn't want to bother my parents or another person like that. But I just keep thinking about it.
The term high-functioning depression seems to fit me rather strongly, since I experience those emotions and no one can tell. I just don't know."
65,depression,I dunno.,"I lost my last friend. Do not even dare to ask me to reconnect. I've been alone for almost a year. I can't do anything. Even in a buss,  i'm just pure ""fuck u n everything else"", i can't even act. Like i usually do.  I'm hollow.  Am i just so evil?  Or is there something? Am i more than just chaos?  Sorry, this might sound retarded, but i dunno how to put this in words. Sorry, don't get upset."
66,depression,I hate having to lie about self harm,My friend just told me that I worry her because I don’t talk about my problems and never open up about my feelings. She was crying and started completely sobbing because she thought about what would happen if I were to cut myself. I told her that would never happen and she doesn’t need to worry but truth is I already have. It’s the one thing I want to tell her but she’s said many times that if she found out one of her friends was self harming  she wouldn’t be able to handle it. I guess I’ll never be able to tell her or anyone ever so that sucks. Not really looking for advice just needed to get it out. Jesus Christ I fucking hate this it makes me want to cut again
67,depression,the fuck do i do??,"my mom is trash and manipulative, but she understands and cares for my mental health. my dad is slightly less trash and he cares about my mental health but doesn’t understand. he yells at me whenever i’m having a panic attack and makes fun of me. i have an ex-step mom but we don’t talk anymore and we aren’t really close but she was the first person i told about my first suicide attempt about three years ago but she’s controlling and yelled at me for 30 minutes about how i should starve myself and how she’s the only person that cares about me. i can’t stay with my friends due to covid and i’m just stuck"
68,depression,Update: I broke up with my abusive girlfriend,"I am so mixed with emotion. Finally I won't be punched, kicked, lied to, forced to have sex. But I'm really want companionship. At least things are looking up for me. I finally have hockey coming up which is where I'm happiest, and my mom is doing her best to find a psychiatrist and counselor. I always thought my parents will always shut me down but they've been so supportive. I don't know what to do or what I'm doing but at least I have people here for me."
69,depression,Trying to sleep is one of the hardest things to do,"Does anyone else just lay there for seemingly hours, wasting away and hoping to finally fade? For me it can takes literally all night and morning. Some days I just don’t at all thanks to anxiety, depression, and stress.

I look up the many ways to help sleep but it’s one of those things that is unique on a per person basis and it seems like nothing works so far. 

Laying on bed has to be the most depressing moment of the day, you re-live every single cringe moment, every mistake, all the possibilities. You get told to just think about nothing but that is practically impossible for someone suffering from severe anxiety. 

Every night I always wish for peace and atleast a mind that isn’t constantly running. It’s never going to happen and it makes me want to cry. Even the simple act of doing nothing is still so , so difficult. 

And so the world goes on, normal people wake up and do their routines while im shaking, sweating, and wishing I wasn’t here."

I then started a new Job i did a couple months training from home and during that time me and my girlfriend of six years split up.  (still friends just decided my new career was taking me in a different direction)  but i was devastated.  I had to move home across the country during a national lock down. Woooo (traffic was great though)  anyway I finished the course and moved onto the next phase of training.

I found a nice place to live, moved to the capital city of my country, started the next phase, met someone nice and we got on well together lock down started to lift and we started hanging out socially distancing etc. all's great.

I got called into a meeting at work and their had been a complaint about me. wouldn't tell me by who or what it was. they fired me. no recourse. not even giving me a chance of telling my side of the story if their even was one. just pack your bags and go.  My lawyers said i cant do anything without wasting a couple 100,000.

I had spent two years. applying for and training. id lost 45KG in weight, spent 1000's moving and buying new clothes. I was being recommended for advanced courses. I was passing all the assessments and written tests with high marks. I had done nothing wrong.

I was again devastated.

I'd lost my career. My apartment. my reputation. and my own security. with just a couple words.

""You're done.""  I will always remember those words.

I packed up. moved home. in the middle of a complete home renovation.

I just don't know what to do. My entire existence for two years has been geared up towards this. and now its gone.

Theirs no work around due to covid. I cant do a degree because i cant fund it and cant get a student loan. I cant move abroad to find work. again due to covid and because i have no formal training in my previous job (carpenter/cabinet maker)  so wouldn't pass the paper shift...

all my friends have disappeared because they where my ex's friends apparently.

My new partner (well newest ex?) is very happy and back with her ex girlfriend.... (that was a curve ball i can tell you)

I'm lying in bed just thinking what can i do? I have family around me that support me but i can see what they're thinking... he failed. again. I put everything my heart and soul into what i do. but it never works.

I feel so alone.  I went through my entire contact list. and the three people i thought id be able to call right now. the sort of friends you call at 4 in the morning and they ask if you need helping hiding a body?  have been dead for a couple years now.

so now i'm looking to strangers on reddit.

Any advice?  I just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Oh and my dog had to be put to sleep last week. so Fuck 2020."
71,depression,Fuck life,Should end this soon. Ain’t getting better. Life is completely miserable. Wish I knew how to end it.
72,depression,I don't know if I want to die,"My mom cussed me out, hit me, told me she didn't love me, that I'm a piece of shit, I'm a stupid sob and then left and I have no one to talk to and I'm only 14, I thought I might've been depressed since March but now I know I am and I also got rejected and ignored all day. And also I don't live with my dad"
73,depression,I don't want to do anything,"Everything feels like so much work, like i feel so lazy. I dont want to deal with people, i dont want to learn how to do new things... And i dont want to spend my life doing something i dont enjoy, living just for the sake of living"
74,depression,I losing faith in my constant screams.,"How many times have I cried and shouted into the void and it never spoke back.

I'm losing track of my count.

I cant seem to come to grips with my pointless and fucking hideous existence.

Its funny, because i always flaunt about how im done with it and have accepted my pointlessness, but my mind keeps trying to cling onto life.

Its acting as if I actually have second thoughts or have a point in this world.

It makes me laugh and cry on the inside.

I should just fucking understand it.


ITS OVER, IM FUCKING SCREWED.

IVE ALREADY DECIDED THE END, IM JUST WAITING FOR MY COURAGE TO ACT OUT.

IM WAITING FOR THE DAY I CAN RUN AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS AND EXECUTE MYSELF.

IM WAITING FOR THE LAST DAY OF MY LIFE.


And ill think about that as I fade out of reality.

I may try to desperately cling onto the world, but its futile.

I deserve this fate, I deserve to be killed.

Everything evil in this world is becoming too much for me to think about.

And im just contributing to the fucking cause.

These yells won't be heard by anybody, they won't be worth anything.

They are going to go into the void and become lost. Like my voice. Like my existence.


Human life isnt always worth the experience, thats as much as I can tell you without being seen as an insane person.

Bye."
75,depression,"I’m depressed when I’m by myself, because I think I have nobody, but when I’m hanging with friends, I’m still depressed","Does someone know what’s wrong with me? It seems that no matter what I try, I still feel depressed and alone... even when I’m with my closest friends. Nothing that I have tried to do mentally works, can someone help? I just feel stuck and trapped inside my own mind"
76,depression,I’m pretty much some,"Our divorce finalized a few months ago, although we tried making it work afterwards by saying, we both still loved each other very much, or so I thought. From one day to another she’s told me she wasn’t in love with me anymore and instead of telling me she tried ghosting me... I’ve never been so hurt in my life. I’ve dealt with depression for years now but now I can’t function properly. There’s a lot wrong with me and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m in a hole but I’m not trying to get out of it, I’m used to this hole. I guess this is my life now."
77,depression,I had troubles falling asleep for quite some months. Listenings To Soft Water Sounds has helped me during these times. (Link Below),"Greetings,  
as allready said in the title i had some troubles falling asleep for quite some time.

Listening to water sounds really helped me falling asleep during these times.

78,depression,I thought i was done with this but here i am again,"Im tired of feeling alone in this big world, why does no one listen to me? People just talk over me. Immediately they just start talking about themselves or whatever they want, im frustrated, mad and sad. Why do people feel superior than others... so selfish... self minded. I hate it so much. I can’t put it into words. I try my best. I want real human interaction but I can’t seem to achieve such a thing. A world full of people and i still feel alone. Many of us do."
79,depression,Came to a realization tonight 🌻,"After a pretty intense fight with my girlfriend, I was feeling pretty low. Today wasn't that great either, regardless. After the fight however, I talked to one of my friends and together we talked through some of my anger and emotional problems.

 The realization: I've been trying so long to be happy without doing anything positive.

I realized tonight that just wanting to be happy wasn't enough, but that in fact, I need to be more positive with myself. I need to look after my well being just as much as I do others. I need to make sure I'm doing the thing I enjoy too. I need to say positive things to myself. And more importantly;
I need to show others that I do have positive thoughts and feelings. 

I spend so much time talking about the negative, without saying anything positive. That is changing tonight.

I dont know if anyone else will relate to this, just my personal depression journey 

Hope you're doing alright, and no matter what it will get better 😁"
80,depression,Really need advice please,"Hey, I would really appreciate some advice with my dilemma. So sorry for the length, please bare with me. I really, really need different peoples take on this. 

I met my first bf at 16 (him 19 &amp; his first relationship) 3 years ago. Before I met him I struggled heavily with depression &amp; when he came into my live it was literally a new lease on life. 

We were so happy when we were together, I thought of him as this wonderful enigma, someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with because he was ‘perfect’ in looks, humour, character, and always had me interested with his intelligence. It was going amazingly. 

However, when we werent together, he could be distant at times &amp; I just felt like someone was off. Given my mental health, my anxiety would kick in and I spent about 3 months during my high school exams being completely at war with my mind over my sanity and becoming someone I hated. 

I had my suspicion that he was talking to someone in particular (someone he started talking to but it never went anywhere before me). I would ask to see his phone &amp; would check up on when he was active on messenger &amp; question him on it. He would profusely tell me he loved me so much and would never do anything like that to hurt me &amp; I couldn’t do anything without proof but go on because I loved him with all my heart as well. Obviously this only pushed him more away because it was controlling but part of me knew in my heart that he was lying. 

One day I was checking after we said goodnight over text on messenger to see when he was last active and this other person and saw they both went offline at the same time (e.g 42 mins ago) and decided to check his phone when I next stayed over. I found on his snapchat when he was in the shower he was talking to them &amp; sending them nudes on snapchat by his username &amp; nicknamed him something else and later on in the day asked to see his phone &amp; confronted him, he tried to pretend it was a workmate until I mentioned the username. It led to a lot of pain and crying on both sides and he said that my crying scared him and he would never do anything like it again. 

After that he spent 6 months trying to repair our relationship &amp; I was trying to give us another chance but I wasn’t strong enough and my anxiety plagued me often, I couldn’t trust him again. He then went to uni 3 months before we finally split which put a strain on things a lot but we tried to video call almost every day and we would laugh &amp; tell each other about our days which made things easier. But it was also hard because he wasn’t out as gay because he thought his dad would be disappointed so only his close friends knew and his best friend didn’t really like me unfortunately. 

When I went to stay in his accommodation one time however (to get away from sixth form &amp; my parents who effected my mental health a lot) I saw a pack of condoms in his see through draws (visible form his bed) &amp; of course was destroyed. He claimed he only used them on himself, however we spoke about breaking up before he went to uni with my impression being he wanted to be free to have sex. We spent about 2 days miserable &amp; I demanded he tell me secrets he was hiding from me and 1 by 1 they came out. He had downloaded grindr several times throughout our relationship and had another phone in which he used for it &amp; hid behind his desk... he once again was crying &amp; didn’t want to lose me but it broke me. I threatened myself with a knife &amp; to run away to get the truth out of him. (I didn’t want to hurt myself but knew the extreme was the only way). He called the police because h was worried I would hurt myself&amp; the officers arrested me because they saw we had a bit to drink &amp; they thought I threatened him with it. He pressed no charges as he never intended I was arrested &amp; I was released the next day. After that he seemed to have little interest in me and we were both drained &amp; I went back home. 

Then 2 weeks later he came home from uni a week before Christmas and broke up with me. I said I would block him on everything as I knew I was too broken to be able to handle being friends  and we never really spoke since. He only lives about 20 mins walk away (family home not uni which is hours away) but thankfully haven’t ran into each other. 

No matter how much he hurt me I couldn’t bare to lose him. He was the love of my life &amp; my soulmate. But in time I saw that it couldn’t have gone on because it had not been healthy for a long time. Given my mental health &amp; it being my first relationship, in retrospect I saw that  I could be overbearing at times &amp; would vent to him about my mental health and my shitty parents &amp; it was terrible that I was driven to be controlling &amp; how extreme things got in the end. 


It’s been 3 years &amp; I have been with someone else now for 2 who is kind, caring, would never cheat on me loves me. I am so healthy mentally and don’t struggle with my mental health very much anymore and feel great about myself, I’m a completely grown &amp; changed person. 

I love him &amp; respect him, but a large part of me still clings to my first partner. Despite how toxic things became and the mistakes he made we were madly in love. Every date felt magical, the memories we made together felt like they would stand the test of time. The times we upset each other or went to breakup we would historically cry because we couldn’t imagine life without each other &amp; with who I’m with now, nothing ever feels magical &amp; all consuming in the way it did with my first. I think about him several times a week whether it’s because of dreams or things that remind me of us. 

I know soul mates don’t exist but I just can’t seem to move past it. I would never want to risk losing who I’m with now because he treats me right and loves me and I love him.  
I can’t describe how guilty I feeling that I can’t move past it completely but as much as I love him I feel like we’re very comfortable and we’re very close but there’s not much excitement in comparison, my heart doesn’t beat fast on dates and I don’t feel in awe in the way I was with my first. 


I honestly think subconsciously I wish we could talk &amp; get date as grown people because we just worked so well asides my mental health &amp; his sexual urges. The last few words he said to me were about the possibility of getting back together one day after uni but I knew I had to get on with my life and get myself together and forget about him for now in order to be the person I am now. But I also worry he only thinks of me with mainly distain and as the young, insecure, version of myself just before we broke up.  And now that I am and I’m confident in myself and am in good health, I can’t help but wonder why even with having someone love me and years between us, why I can’t move past him and whether I should explore messaging him asking him to meet an see how I feel ? I wouldn’t ever cheat on who I’m with but sometimes I wonder if it would give me confirmation on how I feel whether that would be to move past him or explore it depending on who he is now. I don’t believe in once a cheater always a cheater &amp; that people grow and change but just wonder what Reddit’s take is. Thanks so much for hearing me out, it’s the only thing that upsets me in my life regularly &amp; I need to work through it because avoiding it all this time hasn’t ever made it go away. Thanks for letting me get this out there :) 


Tldr (can’t get past ex, even with being with someone else for double the length of the relationship). 

(Btw I have had Counciling for 5 years with my mental health starting before I met him and found little benefit from it in case someone suggests it)"
81,depression,I used to sometimes have the thought that maybe I had died and this is hell,"I'm fixed now but was wondering if anyone else has had that thought. There is hope. I used to think this all the time until I did ECT + found the right med combo.

Edit : I think it might have been a sign of minor psychotic depression"
82,depression,Everything sucks. Life is pain.,"Believe me, I’ve tried. 
I work at a supermarket so I get a decent look at a lot of people and it gets me thinking.
Life is so crap and depressing.
Seeing some elderly people alone, or even some together but you know one will die before the other, causing pain somehow. Seeing some shit, drugged up parents, or just people who seem sad. And then there’s actually some who have a great family and are polite to me. 
And just generally thinking, I’ll never be as happy as all these people. 
I think, why would I need to stay alive to the point of being old when I’m going to be miserable for my whole life? 
I think I’ll give myself maybe another few months tops before I finally, finally give up on everything. 
I’ll give myself a chance to try and shed some light on some points of life, try to see some positivity, but at this point, all I can do is be depressed about my own life, and be hurt that I know others are in pain, and there’s nothing I can do about it but be a polite person and serve them.
I just hate other people being in pain. It makes me so sad.
But I’m in pain, and I just want to die.
If you read this far, I’m sorry, I know it doesn’t make sense, I’m just rambling."
83,depression,Has anyone ever been through this?,"Has anyone ever been to the point where no matter how much you try to be a caring person, honest, supportive..people will manage to see you as the worst person there is..where they tell you to be real and honest, and as soon you do so, they take in offense to it.....has anyone ever been to the point of having cherophobia? Of having a point of your life being happy, then suddenly being fucked over for either no reason or something that you did unintentional. To the point you’re fucking scared to do or say anything cause you don’t want to offend or hurt anyone who are close to you...I’m getting to the point of why even try to be a decent person in this world (can’t say good person knowing I’ve made mistakes in my life, as well far being a perfect person knowing there’s no such thing as a perfect person)...me wanting to be honest, supportive, caring person...but now I’m terrified...scared to lose more people, scared to open my fucking mouth, scared on doing a act of nice...just so tired of this..."
84,depression,How are you supposed to get better when you can't get better,"I think about the future an get depressed, there's nothing I can say I want. 
I'm incredibly lonely, yet human interaction leaves me drained and exhausted.
They say the change takes time but every time I feel I start to get better the exhaustion and brain fog hits me like a tonne of bricks. I don't understand anything anymore,don't know being dramatic but kinda feeling like im done, doesn't seem worth it to me"
85,depression,I don’t remember a time where I wasn’t depressed.,"I’ve gotten really good at not thinking about it. I laugh more than anyone I know. I sink myself in TV, movies, books, and video games just to not think about it. I thought it was just my circumstances when I was a kid, but it just never stopped. 

The only reason I’m alive is because I’m too afraid to end it."
86,depression,Did i mess up,So a long time ago I met this girl we became really good friends but 2 years later she started losing interest and just started saying mhmm and uh huh yo everything I say even stuff like questions and venting about person life so I mustered up the courage to get her out of my life and after that I realised how lonely and unneeded I am should I have just sucked it up and at least have her to talk to even if it meant not having a reaction
87,depression,What living with severe depression feels like mentally and physically,"Mentally
I hate my self for being like this, for not being able to “snap out of it” for watching as I exhaust and drain everyone who tries to care for me. My brain fires a relentless assault of existential questions targeted at the monotony of life for which I have no answers, I’m left feeling like there’s no point. I’m constantly met by horrific screams of “you are a failure” “you are worthless” and despite my attempts to return the screams with “positive thoughts” they don’t stop coming, usually returning with even more fervor. I can feel my cognition and capacity slipping as I have to re-read simple sentences sometimes four or five times to understand them. I have no interest in other people’s lives and feel as though their ignorance to the inherent suffering is their bliss - I wish for such ignorance. I remember when I was ignorantly blissful and “normal” and wish to go back as I constantly replay memories in my mind. I consistently see methods to harm myself and envision what your life will be like without me in it. I battle with the meaning of life and whether God is real. I want to have faith and a reason to be alive, and beg God for it daily. Fear of hurting you and being eternally damned ultimately cause me to hold on tonight though death seems like an unavoidable and near fate. 

Physically
I can feel my body shrinking away as I refuse food; my muscles ache with atrophy from lack of use; my limbs feel like lead and refuse to get up from the bed - only tossing and turning as the clock ticks on; simply standing up induces dizziness - so I stay where I am; my chest aches from the pain of vomiting repeatedly during anxiety attacks and only heaving up stomach acid; my hair is falling out and breaking off after becoming matted from lack of care; my teeth are sore from the constant grinding of a clenched jaw; as I toss and turn, I can smell my own body odor as I refuse to shower and disgust myself further. I wish for the physical pain to stop. 

I am as a rabid animal -  stuck inside the body of a human. Sleep is my only escape."
88,depression,Depression really sucks the life out of you.,I know the feeling of not wanting to get out of bed and dealing with another day of miseary  especially when I feel like a walking corpse but I do.
89,depression,The lowest I've been in years.,"I've been on anti-depressents for about two years now. They helped for a while, but recently, they seem to not help as much. For reference, I was diagnosed with clinical depression, a severe anxiety disorder, insomnia, PTSD, and bi-polar was a possibility but I switched insurance so I wasn't diagnosed at the time, pretty sure I don't have that though.

I feel so lonely. Disconnected from the world. Perhaps a lot of that has to do with staying at home more. I don't know. I just hate this empty feeling I have. I feel like the time I have on Earth is being wasted. I don't know what to do."
90,depression,In the midst of depression being told you're great makes me feel worse,"I really understand the sentiment of support behind being told you're great, fantastic etc but when I'm told I'm great and I really don't feel that way the gap between the two just makes me feel worse.

I feel ashamed that I should be something but currently so far away from it, the gap is enormous and just makes me more depressed to understand how things got so bad.

Sometimes, I'd rather support tell me the truth, that I'm doing shit, feeling terrible but try and work on it bit by bit. Saying you're amazing is so far away from my current reality that I just feel worse."
91,depression,"I litteraly do not see myself dying any other way than killing myself. Like I'm on timer, it may not be today, may not be tomorrow, but eventually I'll finally do it.","My heart hurts, there are days where I just want to throw up. There are nights where my head feels like its screaming me about how much of a burden I am to my family being a asthmatic, autistic, 19 year old who doesn't have a job. The list goes on but im trying to keep some peace and quiet in my bedroom."
92,depression,"I have nothing anymore, I wish I could do it I wish I wasn’t such a pussy","All my friends abandoned me without even telling me why, no body loves me back, I hate my job, the only light and comfort in my life was shot and killed, and starting Monday I have to sit in front of a screen for 5 hours a day while all the other schools around me get to go back and be social... I just can’t do this shit I have nothing anymore, I just wish I could end it I wish I wasn’t such a fucking pussy... I’ve felt this way since 2017 it doesn’t end and it never will"
93,depression,"I am going to try to give it my best, but if that fails things are not looking good for me","I need other people in my life. I literally have like only one friend I talk to, but we never even actually hang out or anything; besides him I have NO other friends. No girlfriend, never even been on a date, held hands, etc. And I'm 24 going to be fucking 25 by the end of this year. I was going to try this year to get out more, and I did what little I could, but with really no results to show.

I am going to give it another go once whenever this COVID shit ends, but if that fails....

&amp;#x200B;

Just absolutely alone and bored as fuck"
94,depression,Alone,"I right this now at 3:40 am. I can’t sleep I feel alone. Someone is laying next to me but I don’t feel like she is here, I don’t feel like I am here. 

Tonight at dinner I completely checked out. She was telling me a story about her friend, I couldn’t but help to think that I will be him. 55 alone, chasing someone that can’t love me or won’t love me. The night that had started out so well I think was ruined by that. She talked to her friends, she had the biggest smile on her face I had ever seen her have. I have never made her smile that way.... I know I can’t. 

I feel like I should take in this moment. Live in the present with the person next to me. She came to see me on the drop of a dime because she knew I was in trouble. For some reason I still feel alone. 

I can’t get the past mistakes I have made out of my head. the years dealing with regret from poor choices and broken relationships. I should focus on the present and future rather than the past, but it drags on my like an anchor. I am not sure how much longer I can hold on. 

Tomorrow she will leave and I will truly be alone. I am not sure it really matters, I feel so alone right now."
95,depression,Seeing people together and happy makes me think I shouldn't be there,Everyone speaking with each other happy and laughing I watch and feel like it's best not to join in it's not like I'll make a difference and I wouldn't make anything better
96,depression,This is gonna get lost but I don't fucking care anymore. (TW),I just need to rant. I'm in so much fucking pain and no one fucking cares. It's currently 5 am and I can't sleep. I really really want to cut but throwing 10 months away would hurt even more. I'm trying so damn hard to drown these thoughts out with music and that has always helped but I feel more alone than ever and I don't know what to do....
97,depression,"I don’t know what the point of living is, if it keeps being like this.","

I want to clarify at the top of this I am not actively sucidal, I just feel hatred twoards life.

Outwardly, I seem normal/happy based ok societies expectations. I’m a 6,2 white guy, prolly a 7-8/10, going to a top 20 school, and my parents basically shit money.

The issue is my life has just fucking sucked. I have ADHD and mild Autism. My parents divorced when I was a kid becuause my dad crash and burned on coke and I’m a single child who has basically never had a family. I was bullied really badly in school and was in sped till 6th grade (was told I would never live a normal life when I was 4). I have basically never had friends and was diagnosed with depression in 3rd grade.

Since then things have just been worse. My mom had an abusive ex for 3 years, and I saw her almost get killed twice, as well as lie face done in a puddle of her own blood.

Once he left, my mom took her problems out on me, and was emotionally and physically abusive to me for 4 years of high school. She alienated me from everyone but her and basically made it impossible for me to hang out with other kids. It didn’t really matter though, because I swear to god I didn’t have a single* friend in high school, and spent almost every day a miserable wreck. My grades sucked ass, I never studied and played video games in class, and finished with a 3.3.

My high school was a prep school in the American south. This was a terrible place to be a gay hippy.

The only friend I did have was a girl, who I ended up dating for a year, and she was ducking insane and super possessive. Told me we had to wait until marriage to do anything and then had full on sex with two other dudes. Also told me if I dumped her she would kill herself and accuse my friends* of sexual harassment.

The only solace I found through all of this was in an extracurricular activity. I compensated with my general failures at life by grinding like 10 hours a day at this one thing, until I was top 5 in the world in rankings, and met a few friends who I got see every 1-2 months at competitions.

Now I’m in my first week of college and I was holding on for it to get better. So far it hasn’t. Everyone I have met at my school is either a full on jock or a preppy asshole. Some people are meh, but I just can’t find anyone I actually like. One of the things I was the most excited for was meeting other LGBT people, since I was the only one where I lived. But nope. Got called a straggot and told I was basically not gay enough. So far everyone in my dorm seems to have best friends, and is just completely ignoring me. I get that I need to join clubs and stuff, but I feel like if this is the school population I don’t think that will matter much.

I just want someone to care about me, and treat me as an equal. Throughout my entire life nobody: my parents, other kids, my GF, has ever actually made me feel wanted. I always feel like I’m unwelcome or at least tolerated.

I’m sure this post makes me seem like a literal incel , but I’m pretty outwardly social and have normal hobbies, it’s just I feel incapable of making meaningful connections."
98,depression,I’m scared I’m out of time,"Hey guys! I just wanna rant for a minute, I don’t really want to burden any of the people I care about with this stuff, so I’ll burden you ;) 

I’ve been depressed as long as I can remember, or at least when I was younger I had terrible mood swings, and didn’t really know how to control what I was feeling or why I was feeling it. I’m now 21(M) and I understand my depression much better.

I know kids aren’t always a product of their parents, but just my happenstance I think I’m a perfect mix of mine. My father is an alcoholic, he’s dabbled with a lot of drugs in the past as well, but his main vice has always been alcohol. He gave up on his life, and his family a long time ago. I still love him, but he’s a shell of who he used to be.

My mom, who I currently live with, is possibly the most emotionally inept person I’ve ever met. She’s also one of the most caring women I’ve ever met, though. She works part time from home, and really has no drive to succeed in any fiscal or social way. She’s as depressed as I am. Yesterday, we got into a tiny argument that ended with her screaming that she was ready to jump in front of traffic. 

Sorry for the long post, basically, school is starting on Monday for me and I’m not even the tiniest bit ready. My anxiety is killing me, and I’m positive I’m going to fail. I’ve always assumed I’d get to the age where life got too difficult, like early 20’s, and then I’d kill myself. I just think that maybe the time is coming up. I don’t think I have the drive that it takes to succeed in life, I don’t think anything makes me happy enough to warrant spending the effort on. It feels like everything I do I’m apathetic toward. Like my brain takes my experiences and filters them through a layer of unhappiness and discontentment before I really get to process them. 

Sorry for ranting. I’m just really scared. I don’t have what it takes, for anything, let alone school. I wanna give up."
99,depression,Anyone want to chat for a bit?,I've been struggling with chronic depression for the past maybe 20 years and i figured that it's time to find someone who can relate a bit or help me feel a tad bit better about myself.
100,depression,Came to a realization (a positive post),"So I visited my mom and sister on my days off this past Monday and Tuesday. I confided in them something I've been too afraid to tell anyone before. I was worried I'd be considered schizophrenic. But for the last like 15 years or so I've had a voice in my head that repeated all of the negativity that has been shoveled into my brain by my ex husband and most recent ex bf (2years ago) I explained it to them and they made me think even stronger that I was schizo. I went home and decided to tell my boyfriend about it, we had a talk and even though neither of us are Drs of any kind we came to the realization that it was my own inner monologue that had been battered and bruised so badly it was there feeding me the negativity regularly. I realized it's my own inner voice and managed to suppress the negativity with positive thoughts. I can't believe that, that is what worked but somehow I woke up yesterday and today feeling amazing, the depression is still there I think I'll probably have it forever but the negativity is gone. 

Great example of this would be at work @02:00 to 04:00 on weekdays there's a special event for UPS trucks and we have to hand out special sheets of paper we fill out for the drivers, usually when the other employees do it for me that makes me feel really down and sad, but yesterday I didn't feel so down about it.

I'm hoping this positivity lasts forever. One can only hope, yes?"
101,depression,I wrote a poem...,"For once in my life can I please find someone who cares?

Someone who walks in, understands and stays there

Someone who sees I’m broken and cannot be repaired

Someone who is willing to stand beside me and help me bear

This fucked up life and skin that I’m forced to wear

I did not ask to be born this way in this nightmare

In this life full of pain and despair

Why can’t someone answer my prayers?

Walk into my life, hold me tight and make me theirs

For once in my life can I please find someone who can help me?

Someone who can see past the fake smile and see that I’m on my knees

Can people stop standing around watching me drown in this sea?

Of denial, hate, abandonment and tragedy

For once in my life can I be carefree

To run around and hurt people like they did me?

No, for that is not who I am you see

I am like the good ol oak tree

I give you shade, a place to rest when you need me

And then you can chop me down and be free

Move on to the next, bigger, beautiful tree

While I lay there like an amputee

Who had no say in the matter or choice of any degree?

I did not choose this life and soon everyone tires of me"
102,depression,I hate beating myself over little things,"Every time i make a mistake, no matter how small, i get so frustrated w myself that i self harm and it's just stressing me out so much. i wish i didn't feel this way about myself anymore."
103,depression,"And they're back, ladies and gentlemen","I'm sure you all know how it is by now. You feel fine for a while and then out of the blue...the feelings are back.

I'm sitting in my bed, tearing up at 2:30 while thinking about life. The funny thing is that things aren't even too bad right now, compared to how they were but I just wanna die.

Don't worry guys, I won't kill myself...probably. Mainly cause my mum's got a brain tumour so she's not able to move her body, speak, or even remember who I am. And to top it all off, she's got Coronavirus. I simply cannot do that to my family, no matter how much I want to.

I just feel awful for no reason. Depression and anxiety will do that to you, I guess. And I know that my mum's condition doesn't really have anything to do with me, but just writing about it has made me feel a little better.

Is it weird that I don't want to feel better? I've been like this since I was about 6-7, I'm 23 now, I'm kind of used to it now. It's kind of the 'norm' for me, and being happy doesn't feel right...

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, I know none of that probably made any sense at all, but I'm not really in the mood to write things properly."
104,depression,Tomorrow,Tomorrow is another day. Another damn day where I do nothing but rot in my own dread and sadness. Another day of me craving a bullet in my brain but not doing it because I'm a fucking coward. Another day where I pretend everything is ok so that I dont get thrown in an asylum. Just another day out of eternity.
105,depression,tipping point,"today, i learned that i didnt pass my school year. as if 2020 couldnt get any worse, (pushing away good friends on top of everything thats happening globally), it did. i dont even have the energy to complain anymore. i have never SH'd, but ive come close more than a couple times. i feel like im too much of a wimp to do it. ive come scarily close to killing myself in the past, and today has definitely pushed me over my tipping point. i just really feel like im useless and cant do anything right. most of the people that ive talked to about failing said it was my fault. and frankly, i think it is. ive been so lazy all year (literally just sitting on my ass doing nothing/playing videogames and ignoring homework), and barely passed last year too. i just dont even know what to do anymore. its not even the fact i didnt pass that gets me, its the shame ill receive this year. i can just imagine everyone i know being so utterly disappointed in me. i dont even feel like trying anymore. for fucks sake, i cant even SH correctly. worst of all, im about to lose one of the only things i still have: my reputation."
106,depression,"I'm 15, but I don't think I'll make it to the end of this school year. (Long post)","

I hate the way my life is right now. All I do is waste my time, day after day, just playing video games or watching YouTube/anime. I haven't left the house in a month, because of my social anxiety. People just scare me, I feel like every person I walk by on the street is judging me in some way and I have no close irl friends left to go out with.

My entire social circle is online, I only talk to people thousands of kilometers away. Some of which are actually real friends and I probably wouldn't be here if they didn't support me, as they are the only people I'm comfortable enough with to talk to about this. Another problem is, since I basically live online, I've gotten quite comfortable with English, but I have gotten worse at my native language. I struggle to hold a normal conversation irl and I'm scared people find me annoying when I have to literally pull out my phone and translate a word or even a sentence from English. Luckily, my mom is fluent in English, so I can at least talk with her by using a weird mix of English and my native language.

Last year was my first year in highschool with a whole new class and I failed horribly at making any kind of personal connection with anyone of them. I'm just that shy guy in the back of the room everyone kinda likes but no one really knows outside of some small talk during breaks. And the sad thing is, I don't think I *want* to make friends with any of them, they're just not my people.

My sleeping schedule is beyond fucked, I stay up to 4-6 am and wake up past noon, still feeling like shit, but I just can't fix it, to fall asleep I have to be left alone with my own thoughts and usually all those are just me telling myself that I should just kill myself.

I'm so incredibly out of shape, I feel like a 60 year old man with all my backpains because I don't leave my chair all day and night, but I lack the motivation to do anything that's good for my health.

That's another thing, lack of motivation. My parents always tell me I'm addicted to my computer, but I would disagree. It's just that it's such an easy way to waste time and I can't be bothered to be even a little productive because I always just give up whenever things get just a little difficult.

School is starting in a little over 2 weeks, and I'll have to somehow transition back to a normal lifestyle of waking up before 12 pm and having to work to keep up my grades. I barely managed to finish with a 5,65 (out of 6, grading system where I live is weird) last year, one of the best in my class, but my parents were still not satisfied, I didn't even get a good job or something, all they did was tell me that I need to be more serious next year and that I only got good grades because the teachers were more forgiving because of the quarantine.

This year is going to be even rougher and considering I almost attempted suicide on multiple occasions last year, I know how I'm going to get through this year. I feel helpless. 

I don't have anyone I can open up to, outside of my online friends and I'm too scared to talk to my parents for whatever reason. I have not had a great relationship with them in the past year as they clearly don't like the way my life is, but they don't know why it is like that so they just assume I'm lazy and *it's that damn computer* and hope for the best. Telling my mom would most likely help me a lot, as then she can let me see a therapist or something, but I'm unreasonably scared that things might become worse. Maybe she'll resort to blaming my computer again and take it away, completely dooming me, as the only reason I'm still alive is my online friends.

Although I am by definition suicidal, I'm not in any danger right now. I'm scared that next year I just won't be able to handle it and I'll do something I'll regret.

But it's not like I don't know how to solve my problems. Start working out, go out more often and learn to be more social. I'm just preventing myself from doing them. I lack any motivation to commit to a routine, even more so a workout one and my social anxiety and low self-esteem makes successfully ordering pizza over the phone without having a borderline mental breakdown a massive accomplishment.

I'm posting for emotional support and because I want you guys to convince me to open up and get help from my parents."
107,depression,Family Gatherings,"Does anyone else really feel their depression and social anxiety hit during family gatherings? 

I'm 28 and I still feel like I have nothing to add to any of the conversations going on. 

To my right my sister and her bf were talking to my other sister about them moving in together in another city, a conversation I didn't want to join because I didn't want to start crying. My sister moving away with her sons to live with her bf is something I'm extremely sad about but I haven't really told that anyone and I prefer to joke about it. I'm used to seeing my nephews often, literally saw them growing up in front of me and it feels so weird that they won't be able to come over whenever they want to anymore. We used to live in the same street, 300 metres apart, for years.

Well, and if they didn't talk about that they were talking about work, corona and other stuff and it's always like some kind of battle about who has the most knowledge about things. Just listening in to that and watching their body language is extremely exhausting. 

To my left my mom and the rest were talking about the past and people and I don't know about. Also had nothing to add to that but that conversation was easier to listen to than the other one.

One nephew had already gone inside to take a nap, the other one was sleeping in his chair and I also had to fight to stay awake.

The last 2 hours I was trying my best to keep my eyelids open. Had my dog on my lap and just pet him as a distraction.

So yeah, I'm always just kind of sitting there with nothing to say and afterwards I feel horrible.

Really needed to get this off my chest."
108,depression,This is it,"This is it

I feel like shit all the time. I’m killing my self and nothing will stop me. Don’t gimmie that crap saying it’s not worth it or you’ll regret it because I know I won’t. People always say that they’ll be my friend, but only when they find out I’m suicidal. And they say they’ll never abandon me but in the end they do. So many fucking people. Literally countless have said the same thing, I promise I will never not be your friend, even when I tell them what I’m telling you right now. But I’m the end they always do. They ALL do. No one cares about me, not my parents, not my bird, and I have no friends. I thought I did but just like I thought, they got bored and left me. If anyone could provide some good suicide methods it would be greatly appreciated.   I’m an ugly piece of shit, who’s fucking retarded and an annoying asshole. I’ll never have a single friend, let alone anything beyond that. I deserved to die. Nothing about me is good. Maybe I’ll try and take some fuckwads down with me. And I know people will say, “no you can’t that cruel and bad” you think I give a single fuck? I’m killing myself, I’ll do whatever the fuck I want. Also if I could get some encouragement to suicide, it would be greatly appreciated as well, don’t want to coward out like the thousands times before. And no, I’m not just a cringy kid who wants to kill themselves for no fucking reasons all the time, but I bet that’s what most people will think anyways. I’m counting the second till I work up the final push to die. I’ll do something right, something that sets me free. Fuck you and fuck everyone."
109,depression,i hate my fucking life,Sometimes i feel happy but sometimes i hate my stupid ass gad damn life it always feels like nobody even cares. Especially when i try to vent i yell and punch my things and my parents haven't realized that i have anger issues and who knows what else i always want to cut myself  because i like to see my blood drip down onto the cold hard earth. I like to get in trouble because it gives me attention because there's apparently something special that he has that i don't maybe love in his heart or kindness. Also whenever i vent the way i do my parents tell me to stop and i fucked up my life. So i would go do things but there's the whole quarantine thing also my chain on my bike just broke today so now it's just a piece of garbage  the only thing i like to do is play video games but i can't do that either so my only escape is going to check the mail and that only takes 5-10 minutes. so i try to sleep a lot but it doesn't help i want to die but there no way that i can access to be able to do it quickly and i don't wanna die slowly either because it will hurt a lot. anyway ima just try to chill for a while but ya i really just like to go into the mirror and say man i really am just a fucking disappointment anyway peace
110,depression,One of those nights,So I’m popping pills and drinking cause I just want to be numb. It sucks that as numb as I want to be I am still thinking about not consuming too many calories. It sucks to think even when I want to be numb I think about calories. At least pills have no calories lol

112,depression,"I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago and I thought I got better, but what if I’m just high functioning now?","I had major depression about a year ago with most of the token symptoms, and it was obvious from the fact that I cried a lot for no reason and shifted back and forth from feeling hopeless to empty. After some major life changes and therapy, I felt okay again.

However, I’ve been noticing things recently that don’t feel right. I still oversleep regularly (sometimes as much as 19 hours per day), I have to force myself to engage in social activities (I used to be an extrovert), whenever I finish my work I tend to just lock myself in my room for hours and ignore everything (I didn’t use to do that), and I stopped crying and being miserable but now I’m an extremely negative person and it’s like I somehow seek out things that make me angry. I don’t feel sad often but everything just feels so routine now and I don’t realize how exhausted I get until I have free time. Should I consider talking to someone about this?

117,depression,A poem,"NECROMANCY or BONG MAINTENANCE

     Here I am, dug in at the edge of the world. Too many have taken me for granted, overlooked me, or blindly harshly passed judgement upon me. Never am I asked for an uninterrupted statement that's not immediately treated as lie. Eyes remain averted while I struggle to rise upon bloody broken limbs and prove myself. At no point were we sat down with an outline of what and how to mend. There was no true mediation obtained or expectations to follow and have a second chance. Of all my faults, undoings and stupid mistakes there's only a few I'd wish completely away or for a chance to make right.      

     I wish to force time back but only for a few short moments. I would shed my skin, these cold walls, my insanity and every wrong great or miniscule. I would do anything and everything just for these few desires and wants. To have these things turn out better at least if not completely different and beautiful. To have these things not crumble underfoot as the silence and distance grow. Just a few things I would sacrifice my pathetic soul to change and save for others a wanted and deserved lifetime and world.
 
     I cling to the moments and looks once passed, the tears and laughter shared. The embraces that healed and brought me back from distant chaos and to life and love. To have another that knows me, that can decipher the craziest ramblings and one that has faults of their own and can accept the vast imperfections that I am.
 
      I'm here, digging in. Whether or not others see or comprehend what and why I am digging in and holding on. My expressions of emotion and thought maybe misread or just ignored. I have watched and held the hand as life, love and dream fade forever from this existence. All the broken thoughts, the pains and pleasures of this existence and moments that will never be.
 
     Throughout this nightmarish somewhat painful, mistreated and tattered life I've held on to few things. The tangible has seldomly played importance, given me satisfaction or given me the drive to obtain and cherish. Even the few people whom I can say I bonded with seem more fleeting and dreamlike than real. I preserved a dream. Just a simple but very vivid dream that remained perfect and unchanged over many years.

      Somehow I feel like a fluke of the world, very much removed in many ways. Not quite robotic, and strange (I am definitely) but not alien. This dream and wish was one of very few things that made me feel like a real person. For half my life I didn't think I would be granted even a remote chance at having anything close to the dreams I held dearly. I know it's not seen clearly or expressed enough and loudly. I'm absolutely astonished by this creation of ours and excited to see the love and dream in the flesh.

      I would only have but a few things that I would ever change in my existence. Of course I would wish to have my mom and to cherish any extra moments. I wish that I was able to love, grow and conquer the world with you for as long as I had mom at least. I know I may not get many years more than mom. It was my fault, my nightmares, and stupidity.
    
     I thoroughly loved you, all the wonderful things and all of the flaws. I was capable accepting everything and letting you have anything I only wanted you, but I failed. I felt like I had no voice or place in your beautiful soul. But I am my own enemy, I'm the black cat in the way carrying a broken mirror."
118,depression,Feels like it won't get better,"I feel so alone, so lonely, so horney (and worried its making me desperate) and so unwanted. Ive lost my closest friends, I worked with one yesterday and it was so nice it felt like everything was good again but then i left and it started to just feel like a reminder of what i had. Im trying to put myself out there as much as I can but no one is talking to me or seeing me. Ive been trying to put on a brave face and keep going but its starting to feel like it will never get better"
119,depression,Any advice appreciated,"Hi everyone. Apologies for the long post, but would really appreciate your help and advice.

I'm a rising second year in med school. Never made a suicide attempt but have had suicidal thoughts for the better part of year. They have been worse than usual in the past few months because of the pandemic and because I've been having some health problems, including eye pain and tinnitus (ear ringing) for about five months now. I saw an eye doctor back in June but she wasn't helpful and I won't be able to get another appointment until late September. My parents aren't really the supportive type - my mom will literally pretend as if nothing's happening when she sees me cry - and none of my classmates have any idea how miserable I am on a daily basis. I was talking to a therapist for a while back in April/May but stopped because it really wasn't helping me. I don't think she was a bad therapist; I just don't think the whole therapy process works for me.

I constantly think about quitting med school. I'm passing the classes, but I haven't enjoyed most of them and I hate how a lot of the curriculum isn't even necessary knowledge once you're a practicing physician. If I had to jump into seeing patients right now, including long hours, overnight calls, etc., I really do not think I would survive. Sometimes I don't even think I want to work in healthcare, period. But also I have a hard time distinguishing between my depression and my general apathy about everything in medicine.

How do I move forward? I'm afraid to quit med school or even to take a year off because I have no back-up plan. I'm really afraid that my physical symptoms are never going to go away. I don't expect easy solutions but I just feel so trapped right now."
120,depression,Covid stopped me from getting therapy,"For a while now ive been feeling absolutely terrible, I hate myself so much and I dont know why, it got to the point where I was scaring myself, so I finally mustered the courage to ask my mom to get me a therapist. She agreed, but then the country I live in went into a lockdown and so I never actually got to see a therapist. This was back in March, and I feel like my parents have forgotten all about it, I dont know if I hsve it in me to ask them again, I know I shouldn't be afraid if I already did it once before but I still cant seem to get myself to do it. I dont know what to do anymore, I feel so numb, I don't know why I'm like this, and I know I need to talk to a therapist, but if I cant even ask my own parents to get me a therapist again, is there really any point in trying therapy? Was I just built to live with this pain inside me without the ability to talk to anyone about it? I struggle with basic communication every day of my life, I've never been able to tell people how I feel, why would a therapist be any different?  I dont know anything anymore, I'm just tired of living like this. With each passing day I just get more and more sick of myself. A couple of nights ago I got really drunk and ended up throwing up the next day, and all I could think about was how peaceful I was feeling while I was drunk, and how dissapointed the people who care about me would be. First of all, is it worth living, when you only feel happy with yourself when you're literally poisoning yourself? I'm still so young and I'm already doing shit like this. I don't have high hopes for the future. If im being honest, the maximum age I can see for myself is 30,  hell, even getting to 30 would be a miracle. Secondly, I don't deserve the life I have, there are people in my life who genuinely care about me, and here I am, a sorry excuse for a human being, talking about how much I hate myself. If it weren't for them I would've probably killed myself already. I need help, I know I do, but I can't ask for it, not again, I just can't get the words out, if anyone who knows me is reading this, I'm sorry, I'm a lost cause, im so fucking sorry."
121,depression,Suicide is harder than I thought,I was always thinking if I had a weapon I would kill myself with out pain but now I have a rifle with 60 rounds and I dont know what to do. I was always thinking that it would be an easy decision but its really tough
122,depression,Don’t feel like people really like me,"Do you ever feel like there’s really no one that actually wants to get to know you, or cares enough to really learn about you? I kind of feel like a lot of people around me only somewhat engage because we are around each other and they have to. I guess I’m wondering, am I alone in that feeling?"

124,depression,Why do I suck so bad.,"I have spent the majority of my life alone. I have been surrounded by friends and family. I just can't seem to ever be the right person. I'm 27 and lonely, I've had people say that to me. I was told by my grandfather sometime ago because I'm lucky at cards. Lucky with cards not with love. Do I do this to myself? I don't want to kill myself but I just want to give up so bad. It's really hard! Some days I don't know if I'll talk myself down? This is the only way I can say what's in my heart. I want to be happy but my life just keeps telling me to be sad and I listen."

Really, I hate myself and think by a small chance more muscle on my arm will make me hate myself a little less. I have a very low view of myself so I hate looking in the mirror. I just want to feel worth it. I’m just going to eat and go to sleep. The urge to self harm is getting stronger but I’m too weak to buy myself a blade."
129,depression,"Hey, just wanted to vent and get some help?","Hey guys. So I’m fucking struggling. Everything was going great, me and my boyfriend got our own place, I adopted a cat, that part is absolutely incredible, no problems there at all.

But the past month or two it’s been pretty much impossible to motivate myself once the weekend is over. I’ve called out way too much in choice of just sleeping for 10 hours or drinking and sleeping. It’s just getting to the point where I know there’s something seriously wrong. 

I think my job is a big problem of it- it’s a great job for what it is, I have great benefits, it’s a smaller company that listens, but I’m basically stuck on a computer all day with no human contact. It’s very boring and unchallenging to me.

Plus my parents (who I lived with for 25 years) are about to move, and aren’t taking my younger brother (who definitely has A TON of social issues and also previous substance abuse issues) with them, instead they’re just going to pay for an apartment for him. This is petty but I’m the middle child, have had a full time job or very consistent work since I was 18, and lived with them while constantly trying to/wanting to move out and my mother was a huge part of me feeling unconfident about it so I never felt comfortable making the leap. They cut me off the second I moved out so I’m completely financially independent now, while my brother is 27 and they’re now going to pay for everything for him (including his schooling), and it just kind of feels like a slap in the face. Plus his whole issues with drugs in the past I just have a horrible feeling he’s going to slip back into that being alone.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just don’t want to do anything but sleep or blankly stare at my computer all day. My boyfriend and cat are very supportive and helpful but it’s not fair for me to put this negativity on him. I don’t want to be his burden to carry. 

Idk man. I’m so stuck.

Edit: My boyfriend is the most well adjusted mentally healthy ‘normal’ person I’ve ever met in my life. It’s so abnormal to me how well adjusted he is. He doesn’t ‘get’ the way I feel and can’t relate to it at all (and I don’t want him to honestly), but he’s supportive nonetheless and tries to help.

I’m 99.9% my brother is on the spectrum but my parents are very right-leaning ‘not believing in mental healthcare’ types so I can’t say for sure because he’s never been diagnosed or tested.

I think I’m going to meet with my bosses when I get back to work and explain my mental health issues atm. Which is kind of embarrassing but I mean, they do deserve an explanation. 

I also think I’m going to start looking for other work. I’ve always wanted to work with animals and I’m truly not happy at all in my current job.

Edit #2: I should add I had a huuuuge mental break last month where I was having a normal dinner with friends and had to excuse myself because I started having a crazy panic attack. I quickly paid which was so sus and by the time I left I was so disoriented I just started running and by the time I finally calmed down I was two miles away, laying down looking at the stars. I kind of remember it, but it’s choppy. I mostly remember the start of it and end of it. Either way it’s super fucking embarrassing and not cute. I hate that my mind and body did that to me and I feel stupid and shitty that I didn’t handle it better."
130,depression,Family problems,"I just wanna let this out. I've never told anyone about this so this is pretty big for me. I'm not gonna mention everything because some details just disgust me. I wanted to share this and get it out of my chest.
So, my mom and my father are divorced. He initiated it. My mom agreed. At first she was telling him not to make it so ' official ' and he can just leave without all that paper work and stuff though. 
So, after some time, when there were some 'problems"" with the papers (shocker: turns out that he needs to pay for me monthly) he woke my mom up (she was sleeping at the time) very roughly, told her to go to the living room and they had an argument. And the he hit her in the face. With a fist. All this time I was in my bedroom, sitting on my bed, crying and preying for God to just kill me, make me disappear, anything to get out of here. I really wished for it, I wanted it. I still remember it as one of the worst moments of my life. 
After then my mom went into my room and blocked the door with a table. After some time we put a lock on our bedroom door. And he helped us out it... It's just so messed up, like, what the fuck??? 
Oh, and at one point he decided that he's gonna live with his new girlfriend I guess, and it was awesome. But after some time, one day he came here and started asking me to ""let him come home""! I didn't say anything to him and for 20 minutes straight he was persuading me. The he gave up and still came here. He still lives here. They occasionally have fights with each other. He gets ""offended"" when I don't say hello to him. I hate him!
Now my mom and I live in the same room and this little bitch gets his own room with TV, computer and all that shit. 
He never was a real, good father to me nor to my sister. I just want him gone. 
Thank you for reading. Really, thank you. As I said, It's the first time I'm telling anyone about this. It's not the whole story, but I tried to sum it up. 
I hope you guys are doing good. Love the ones who love you!"
131,depression,Dreamless/goal-less,"Hi!

First time actually making a post and on mobile so sorry for formatting.

TLDR; Tgabks to the pandemic and my own failings I might be jobless without any motivation/dreams for what I want to do while in debt and I’m asking if anyone knows how to turn it around or help me feel better and not depressed. 

Lately the pandemic has hit hard, I work as a chef at a company and have been for over 2 years in a row. 

Around 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 years ago I fucked myself up being depressed and falling into a “smart loan” cycle with me not wanting to have a conflict or trouble anyone refused to ask for help from people or my parents which ended up with me heavy in debt and a bad anxiety over anything surrounding my economics. 

Now as I said I’ve stayed at this company working for over two years even though I earn less hourly than other places and some other costs are both cheaper and higher than they would normally be. This makes it a bit of a sacrifice to my social life and economically I could save more working elsewhere. But I really like working here. With the pandemic going on and the aspect of having to switch work temporarily or sadly permanently my cursed brains has started asking what I want to do....

As a chef you handle a lot of pressure and stress daily in your work life on top of heavy physical work like a lot of bending and reaching which most likely will Frick up your limbs and back not to mentions all the small and large cut and burns you get over time working in a kitchen. Lately (lasts 6-13months) I’ve been feeling tired of working in this business. I’m a foodie at heart, love food and cooking it, all the knowledge and geeky stuff are fascinating. When I started studying to become a chef my dream was to work at Heston Bleumenthals place in London, I even picked a school that gave me a chance to have a intern there if I studied hard and put some effort into it. But as a school tired individual that had put minimal effort into school before starting at my gymnasium that motivation was not found and I didn’t get the chance to intern there. Had some great internship at other local restaurants though which I’m happy with. But that just shifted my goal to one day work there when I had earned some experience. After finishing my studies I went to Japan for the 23rd world scout jamboree, 2 weeks sightseeing and 2 weeks working as a helping hand at camp. During that trip I fell even more in love with Japanese culture, history but mainly food. It was a culinary eye opening. So my goal switched to more Asian food which had always been a small interest since I was a kid.

But the more I worked in the branch the harder to follow a sleep schedule or any time of daily routine for that matter it became. My depression and anxiety started crawling back. During my first job I gained around 20-30kg in just 8 months and hated myself. I couldn’t save money worth a damn, always blew it at some trash/junk food/snack while travelling to work or buying some high end ingredient because as a chef I need to understand the flavours for work I told myself. My social life for a young adult was almost non existent. 

I took a break from the branch and worked at a local store for a year. Decided that I didn’t enjoy it all too much and went to work where I’m at now. But my passion over the years have gone. I have had a full blown anxiety attacks twice in two year’s and I feel as my old life goals are of no interest and I’m just floating around trying to figure something out. With my current job having a uncertain future, potentially closing, I’m left with some help from my current boss to find a new job or a temporary one. I’m still heavily in debt although I worked a lot at fixing that. And if it wasn’t for this pandemic I might have paid off around 40% of the total debt I had at the start of the year instead of the messily 5-10% I have been able to pay off now. And it all feels so overwhelming, I’m soon potentially jobless, in debt, no real place of my own other than the place I rent for work or me moving back to my parents, without any motivation or dreams. What do you do at these times? I’ve gone back to relistening to  audio books I’ve heard over 50 times because I’m trying to get some nostalgic happiness since life is seemingly just knocking me down. Are you supposed to feel this way when you’re 24? What should/can I do to change this?"
132,depression,random thought/vent,"So I basically have no ""true"" friends at all. No-one who will talk to me first or be the one to reach out and it fucking sucks they've pretty much ghosted me. I just had a random shitty thought. Ive been struggling with suicidal thoughts for awhile and I realized that if it does happen all these shitty people are going to pretend that they were my best friend, that they were so close to me and ""oh how can this happen she was so loved"" fuck that. This is morbid and super fucking selfish but I hope they feel bad I hope that instead of missing me they just feel shitty for not doing more. which is so fucked up to feel this way trust me ik I just can't help it idk. It just sucks because these people will be great friends to one another but not to fucking me and idk what im supposed to do or change. Fuck it why do I have to change what is it about ME that just is so un likable or fucking whatever?? Ik some people will say life is worth living and it will get better but I honestly dont see it that way rn. Im fucking exaughsted and I feel so alone. "
133,depression,They all leave me,They all stop they all hate me they all fucking give up
134,depression,Coping and Awareness.,"Let me just start this off by saying that I am in now way, shape or form well versed as to how most people deal with what they go through. 

I suppose there’s generally what people do and such, but I’ve always been one to try and help others. Recently, say the past couple of years, I’ve realized I do it as a way to escape from what I’m going through myself.  It’s not a bad thing I guess, but I’ve come to see that it’s not good either, for myself at least. I love being able to talk to my friends, (very rarely family) and random people on the internet and try to just.. talk. See how they are, how I can help. Usually just as a way for them to vent, as I don’t really have that myself.

Growing up was hard, is hard. I’m only 21, but having dropped out of school (regretfully) and having not had much luck with getting back to it, or with workplace experiences.. it’s tough. I’m very aware of the fact that I’ve *still* had it easy compared to a lot. I never liked to pretend I didn’t. I have a dad who; for whatever reason, decides to put up with me at my worst, and I will forever appreciate it. However, being in the position I’m in still causing me a fuck ton of stress. I’m always trying to figure out what to do with my life, taking moments to see just how far I’ve come since I was a young 16 year old kid who needed help, to being in a situation that’s not all that different, at 21. 

I’m sure I could have put this all together better, and tomorrow I’ll probably look at this and the aspiring writer in me will shiver, but I just needed to post *something* as a way to get some relief. 

That being said, I read a lot as it helps me deal with stuff, or helps to stave anxiety off for awhile anyways. A lot of what I’ve read has hit pretty hard with me, I never really had a typical childhood. I wasn’t treated poorly, physically anyways, as a lot of people are. But I was really secluded, in my own room and head a lot. Didn’t have many friends, and that something that’s carried on with me. (I am however thankful to the amazing handful of them I have, as I’m sure I wouldn’t be here today without them.) I never got to experience small but important (in my opinion) things like, going to prom or going on dates as a teenager. Small things that, in the moment are monumentally important to how you feel about yourself. Even dealing with how I see myself physically and/or sexually.

Even something as simple as getting my thoughts out online seems difficult. Like I’m two halves of something, wanting to put words into structure and then subconsciously unable to. 

Anyways, a small part of me truly hopes for the best. The best for me, my friends and family. Anyone reading this, really. 

It’s just so incredibly painful. 

My life seems to go nowhere, especially when I try my hardest to make anything work. Sorry for how long this all is, I tend to ramble. Even when no one is listening."
135,depression,Es mi culpa?,Que hago  mal?  porque al intentar ser buena persona no me pasan cosas buenas porque el mundo sea cae abajo  y a nadie parece importarle lo que siento
136,depression,Depressed,"I'm going through a lot right now and I'm in a state of depression, which isn't good, compared to my past."
137,depression,what do i do?,"why did the first person who i ever told about my depression to in a long, heartfelt text, have to reply with, ‘omg thats so sad! i feel so bad for not noticing! i’ll try and help you as much as i can because ily!’ and then back at school they just acted (and continue to act) like nothing happened. when i try to ask them for help, they just say, ‘sorry gtg’. what am i supposed to do?"
138,depression,Why do I feel so worthless?..,"I live for other people. My friend seems to have some serious emotional issues going on and I've always been trying to get them to open up about it. They always say ""I'm okay now"" and ""it's fine, I'm good now"" and usually I ask again if they want to talk and I always get a no. Only today did I realize they really just don't want to open up to me at all and never have. I know I'm not entitled to know what's going on but this is my best friend and the fact that they don't trust me hurts. Not them hurting me, but just pain in general. I've been feeling physically sick (extreme nausea) and I've been having random fits of just crying into a pillow for 5 minutes. It feels like the only thing I find purpose and worth in doing is gone. Now it truly feels like I'm just trapped in this life because there's nothing else that makes me feel like it's worth living. I just want it all to end. It feels like I'm faking all of this but I really do just want to die. Either that or physical pain. Whether it just happens upon me or I inflict it on myself, I don't care anymore. I need to feel something other than worthless."
139,depression,I almost had one okay day.,"I was able to get the money together to be able to fill my prescription. I was scared I was gonna go into withdrawal and I heard about “brain zaps” and I got scared. 
But then I got home to an electric shut off notice and I have to pay eighty dollars by tonight basically or they will shut it off. Of course classes start on Monday and of course they’re all online and I won’t have any electric. My gas will get shut off too which means I won’t be  able to cook. I’m not sure if that matters cause I haven’t had food or eaten in days anyways. If it does get shut off, and it will, it will be $150 to turn it back on. My mom is broke. My friends are annoyed by me asking to borrow money all the time even though I always pay it back. ALWAYS. I got to talk to my professor today though which was nice. Sometimes I think he’s all I have and that really fucking sucks. He’s amazing and I love him to death but like. How pathetic is it that my only friend is this guy that I can’t even see anymore. But he gave me a fish tank and it makes me happy to be able to take care of it. But I haven’t even been able to do that with the pandemic. This all just sucks so much. I’m so fucking hungry and now I’m gonna be hungry and hot with no way to even go to my first few days of classes until I get my damn electric turned back on on Wednesday. I’m so tired of all of this."
140,depression,So depressed right now I’m tears,Hi can someone please talk to me I feel so sad like my world is crashing down on me I started thinking about getting older I’m 24 and then how me and my boyfriend might not last forever like we promised I know all this seems trivial to some but it has me so devastated rn what am I going to do without my boyfriend he’s literally all I have and I’m so terrified of getting old I haven’t even done what I want to in this life yet and it feels like it almost over.
141,depression,Vent post,"So I guess this post is really just to vent and maybe have people who understand me. I had a very abuse childhood - like I'm sure most of you have. I was sexually assaulted when I was a child and my parents spent most of my childhood either arguing, threatening to off themselves in front of me and my siblings (my mom, she actually tried to in front of us a lot usually trying to jump out of the car when she and dad would argue in the car she has BPD), and cheating back and forth on each other. I have PTSD, GAD, and depression. I have been on Paxil but was stupid and got off of it after I moved out because I didn't think I needed it. My stress levels were so bad before I was on Paxil that I couldn't gain weight. I stayed below 100 lbs and looked like a skeleton. People thought I was anorexic but I wasn't, it didn't matter how much I ate or how many boosts I drank, I couldn't gain weight. Once I moved out and got married, I gained 30 lbs and felt happier. My relationship with my parents after they got divorced improved, sort of. But there's always a lot of stress and anxiety I feel when I'm around them. I don't see either often as their work keeps them pretty far from my house. Both my parents have new partners. My dad even has a new baby. I should make it clear, I hardly ever got to see my parents growing up especially my dad because of their jobs. I raised my brother and sister since I was 11. So of course I really want to make memories with them but it always seems to cost me mentally. 

Which brings us to today. I have been away from my husband for over a week visiting my dad and stepmom several states away. My husband had work so he couldn't come. I have a puppy who is my ESA, she's actually going to be trained to be a therapy dog too but right now she's just for me. They knew I had a puppy. They know she is a breed that howls. They know she is only 4 months old so she is hyper. They get mad at me for every little thing she does. She is house trained. She doesn't chew on anything in their house. They get mad when she is vocal or makes noises with her toys. I understand they have a baby and don't want him to be woken up, but when my dog is in her kennel with 5 blankets over the top in my room in the basement she is making way less noise than them when they're on their games or the tv. So...it's like a daily occurrence of them scolding me for her making noise. It really just makes me regret the whole trip and I don't leave for another week. I feel like I honestly don't belong here. I don't feel welcome. I feel on the verge of tears constantly. I had a panic attack / break down while walking her. I walk her 5x a day usually just to get out of the house. I just felt / feel so overwhelmed with the thoughts that I don't belong here and that I'm not wanted. I'm not ""alone"", my sister is here and my grandma is, but I honestly feel so isolated. My husband works at a factory so most of the day he is gone. He tries to talk to me when he can but when I'm like this I lash out and it's stupid. I don't understand why I do it. I just feel so on edge, upset, and dark on the inside. Literally the only one who has been here for me I feel like is my dog. When I get on the verge of a breakdown, she curls up in my lap and licks me. When I'm crying, she brings me toys or licks my face. When I'm calming myself down, she lays against me and just sits there looking at me. She clearly cares... I just wish I felt that from everyone else. I *know* my parents love me but they just have a really shitty way of showing it. I came here to spend time with them and my dad's hardly even here and I get roped into watching a baby (who makes my stress sky rocket because of the shrill crying, it makes me feel like I'm going to have a panic attack) that I did not sign up to take care of or I'm getting scolded over my dog. Hence why I walk her so much. I just wish someone understood or that my parents would stop and think for a moment about how they're making me feel. They know about my depression and anxiety. They're the ones who kept inviting me up here. I didn't want to drive 9 hours a day for 3 days just to be like this. I honestly can't wait to go home and I hated the drive. I'm actually looking forward to the drive and I feel guilty for feeling this way. 

I know my dad likes to see me, and I like to see him, but this is the last time I'm driving to see them I think. It's just not good on me mentally. I cry every night. I feel alone. I feel unwanted again. I feel like it wouldn't matter if I disappeared. I'm not having suicidal thoughts. I just feel like sometimes it wouldn't matter if I didn't exist. But then I think about my husband, my pets, and my sister and know how me not being here would affect them. I've been trying to take this $80 cbd stuff but honestly it doesn't work. But I won't get back on Paxil specifically because of how bad the side effects I had were. If I didn't take it on time I'd throw up. When I was weaning off Id get migraines and I'd feel out of it. But I do intend to go to my doctor and see if there is another medicine she thinks is right for me. I just need to manage to get home without another breakdown. 

Sorry for how much I said... I'll probably end up deleting this but it felt good to at least type it up. I'd rather a bunch of strangers online read about my feelings rather than tell my family, sounds so stupid doesn't it?"
143,depression,how do I cope with being an ugly girl?!? (rant),"long text post made on mobile, sorry about that, need some advice or sympathy :(

for all my life I’ve struggled with my appearance and generally the way people interact with me because of it. I’m not like, deformed or anything, but definitely below average and have always been the “ugly friend” in the group. I have insufferable acne (on medication) and frizzy, thin hair with a receding hairline and lots of baby hair, and a big nose and a lazy eye. All of those things just make me so incredibly insecure and hopeless because I will never be as beautiful as my small nosed, clear-skinned friends :( I know this is very shallow and superficial but my struggles with my appearance and dysmorphia make it so much harder to cope and find a reason to live everyday. any advice is appreciated, sorry for the long post"
144,depression,been struggling for nearly half my life,"at the ripe age of 11 i learned what it was like to be chronically depressed. being now 20 and nearly 21, im starting to think it's just never going to get better. ive had so much unresolved trauma ive internalized for almost ten years now and i can't seem to talk to anyone about it. i have such a great support system of friends &amp; a great boyfriend and yet i choose to suffer by myself rather than express how i feel and how ive felt. ive dealt with two deaths, two relapses of an eating disorder, two attempts, developed anxiety, &amp; years of self harm. i opened up to one person in that time and they only knew about the self harm and one attempt. everything else ive dealt with alone &amp; honestly idk how im still alive.

ive been able to keep myself under control and anymore its came &amp; went. ive tried to work towards bettering myself but i fear im going to spiral again. recently ive tried to open up to my boyfriend about what ive been feeling and he's been very supportive but im scared that he'll eventually just not want to deal with me anymore. i dont want to burden him anymore, or anyone else for that matter. i havent self harmed in years in fear that someone would see and ask questions but ive been really feeling the urge to. ive been trying to fight it, being scared he would see it, but i just dont know how to cope. 

ive always told myself ""fake it till you make it"" but at what point am i going to make it?"
145,depression,Ketamine for depression,"I have been prescribed ketamine for my depression. I take it every other day for three weeks then something like once every three months afterwards. I don’t know if it helps depression in the long term, but when I take it it is great. It’s like a break from having your thoughts constantly berating you. Unfortunately the effects are short lived. Has anyone else been prescribed this? How did affect your depression. I have tried numerous anti-depressants and they haven’t worked. There’s also research going on right now to see how psilocybin can help with depression, addiction and end of life anxiety. Anyone ever use psychedelics to help them with depression?"

152,depression,Does it ever Get Better?,"I’ve been pretty on and off with sadness and depression, some days I’m fine, other days I feel neutral, and some days I feel like everything could end and I’d be fine.  I’ve gone for so long telling myself and other on this subreddit that there is always going to be a light at the end of that tunnel no matter how long the tunnel is, but I’m not sure how much longer I can handle the tunnel.  I don’t think I was built to fight this kind of fight, and I can feel myself cracking under the weight.  

Does it ever get better?  I like to believe it will and I’ve done a hell of a fine job convincing myself it will, but throughout my life it has gotten better only to fall to shit.  At this point I can count more bad days than I can good.  I guess I’m just getting really tired of fighting and trying to stay positive.  Sometimes I wish I could just let go and whatever happens happens, but I know it’s not that simple.  I’m just lost and I wish I could be found.

Stories or examples of your life getting better eventually would be great motivation for me to keep going.  Thanks a bunch, love this community to bits."

I don’t feel okay...I still constantly think about buying a gun and killing myself...and I oddly seem more okay with that idea now that I understand my pain better. I have no one. I have nothing I care about anymore. I feel I’m living just because others say ‘do you know how much it would hurt me if you died”, (but they have lives and loved ones.

158,depression,"They always tell you that you should’t keep it bottled up, so why does it always feel worse when I actually talk about it?","I’ve never come out of one of my therapy sessions feeling better then when I came in. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine when it starts, maybe even happy, but then it just turns me into a panicky, anxious, depressed mess.

Sometimes it even feels like it was’t this bad before I started therapy. If anything I think about my trauma and my problems more then I ever did before talking about them.

Even when i talk about my depression to people, and what I went through, it ruins my day. I wish I was able to bottle it back up, I wish I was able to go to my moderately depressed self rather then my suicidal depressed self, what do you do when trying to help yourself just makes it worse."

160,depression,I’m a disappointment,"I’m so fucking depressed and I’m such a burden on everyone. I’m tired of life, I’m tired of living, I’m tired of being an annoying, pathetic, piece of shit. Why does everyone else I know have lives that are better than me? Why does it have to be me suffering. The only thing keeping me on the planet at this point is my grandma and dog, because I’m pretty sure as much as my grandma hates my guts she loves me and just doesn’t know how to show it and she’d be broken if I was gone and my dog would be confused, upset, and wondering where I had gone. And also, one more thing, the fact that I’d go to hell because if you commit suicide you can go to hell. Suicidal thoughts and self harm have really been hitting hard for me lately though probably the last two weeks, I’ve had thoughts of jumping off my moms building, or overdosing on certain medications like ibuprofen and melatonin before bed so it’d make my heart stop painlessly in my sleep, and everytime something bad happens I usually punch myself, scratch myself or pinch myself with my nails until it leaves a mark. I know, it sounds painful but it honestly is alleviating afterwards and I deserve it. I’m probably just going to live an empty, sad, lonely life at this point and I’ve accepted it because I may be fourteen but my life has always been like this and it’s always been a ton of misfortunate events. I have nobody to go to and nobody to turn to. Nobody understands me or what I’m going through. And yeah I may be “smart” and get good grades and have this super “charming” personality but the reality is I’m not smart, I just act like a know it all because it makes me feel better, and I’m not charming I’m just fucking annoying and dumb I don’t understand why people even enjoy hanging out with me and don’t get sick of me after five minutes. And that’s it I guess. I’m sorry if you read my stupid rant this far just honestly fuck life and fuck people, everyone out there in the world is a brainless buffoon"
161,depression,Finding a place to belong,"Depressive for a few good years now ( 7-8 + ) but past 12-13 months have gone really down ( Covid didn't change shit ) Lost pretty much all people that cared about me, either i pushed them away, or they left by themself ( Which i am glad they did, i know they all diserve better. The only person i really regret losing was by old best friend that i knew for over 12 years ) Eitherway, I feel lost. Up, Down, Left and Right.. What's one suppose to do, how does one get up and keep going when there are no reasons to do so? How can one keep fighting when he fights for nothing, and aside that loses pretty badly.  
How does one Find a place where they feel like they belong? &lt;- What's your take on this Simple Question?  


  
Sorry for the long Post!"
162,depression,Idk how to be normal,Everyone in my family is perfect fine except me. I've been depressed for so long. I always feel so alone. I have absolutely nobody. I just wish someone would hug me
163,depression,Anyone else feel like the people in their life try to dismiss their disorder entirely?,"I don't have much to say, but my family, specifically my parents always tell me that my life could be ""worse"" and that I have no reason to feel the way I do, even though I've been in therapy for years and I'm on antidepressants. Just wondering if this is a universal experience or not."
164,depression,I want to end my life.,Just wanted to let yall know. Every single day that passes by I want to kill myself even more. I'm ready to do it very soon. Can't wait to die.
165,depression,Don't you sometimes wish you could go back in time when you were a kid and redo your life ?,"I've been feeling like that lately. That my life has been wasted and it's stagnant. I feel depressed and like shit. However, I refuse to give up, I refuse to believe my life is lost and it has lost any hope of improving and reaching my dreams, and you can refuse too and work towards achieving it. I want to help you do it.

Why and how do you ask ? Why, because this is in my self interest too, I want to help myself too and I will not ask of you more than you will get from me.

How ? By putting together a mastermind group. If you want to google that, do it, I will give you the short explanation. A Mastermind group is the most powerful tool humans had used to change history and their lives, it's when a group of people , come together to work in harmony and achieve an unified goal. How do they do this ? By sharing intellectual capacity. The objective is share ideas, information, advice, accountability, and support in order to reach the group's objective, which in our case will be, improving ourselves and reaching our goals, or defining them shall we lack of them.

The requirements I have thought for this group are the next ones.

* Age 20+
* Discord for the meetings 
* Willingness to help other members of the group with your support, ideas, and to held them accountable for reaching the goals they have proposed for themselves ( The idea of the group is encourage ourselves to be better, not reward our laziness or failures ). 
* Be respectful and willing to cooperate with other members of the group: In order for a mastermind to work members must work in harmony, that meas your personal opinions on how others should live their lives, politics, religion, race, whatever, stay outside of the door when you enter the group. Furthermore, evade arguments like the plague, if there is a problem , let's talk it like civilized people and fix it peacefully and respectfully. 

  
All great people in history have had a master mind like group, friends and advisors who with the sole purpose of helping them reach a goal, gave them support and counsel. 

If you are tired of living like you do, send me DM, let's change our lives together."
166,depression,I plan on killing myself next month,Would you like me to pass any messages along on your behalf?
167,depression,Just snap out of it,What are your responses to people who say that to you? What do you say to coworkers who speak to you like that? Wake up! Pay attention! Why can’t you do this? They basically tell me to just snap out of it.

169,depression,Questions About Therapy as a Teen,"Im sorry if I've misunderstood the point of this subreddit but I wanted to give this place a try. 

I have insurance for children and it hardly costs my parents a thing. I am almost 18 and I will continue to have this insurance till I am 19. 

When i turn 18, is it possible for me to go to therapy WITHOUT involving my parents at all? Could I just show up and make appointments if they take my insurance? Am i able to do this without my parents knowledge?"
170,depression,Haven’t spoken to any friends in months,"I’m literally locked in my room all day every day with my only entertainment being college assignments. Covid is such bullshit, just proof my life is full of incredibly unlucky tragic events. Parents won’t even let me leave cause they are afraid I’ll catch it. BUT I HAVENT LEFT THE HOUSE IN MONTHS, IM FUCKING LOOSING MY MIND. I’m just talking to myself constantly to imitate the feeling of outside contact. Atleast I have a good GPA, still, try studying while you also want to kill your self."
171,depression,Doesnt get easier,"I just cant be arsed anymore. It never feels like it's getting better or easier its just the same thing everyday. I dont want to die I just want to be dead everyday I'm hoping for an accident to just kill me before I even realise whats happening. I just want to be gone i dont do anything anymore with my day beyond waiting for the next time i can go out and drink so I can smile and not just feel like this for a few hours. It feels like everyone I know is moving on and now they dont need me to be there and if I was gone they'd be OK but I cant make myself attempt it again for worries of if soemthing went wrong or traumatising whoever would find me. I just want a sudden accident. The other voice in my head gets annoyed with me for feeling how I do and annoyed I cant even make myself attempt again anymore.

172,depression,Understanding Others - Survey,"[https://forms.gle/HNxj3FVbA2jsgAan9](https://forms.gle/HNxj3FVbA2jsgAan9)

Hello, I'm doing a personal project about understanding others. I'm going to using it to help with comprehending mental health issues and utilizing coping mechanisms .

If you're interested the link at the top is the survey."
173,depression,I feel lonely and have no one to be emotional around,"I’m 16, I spent the last 3 months with my grandpa. I’ll be quick and say I love him more than anyone in the world. But now schools coming up and I’m getting high anxiety, and after every summer I get sad because I know it’s getting closer to my grandpas death. And honestly I don’t think I can live when that happens. But anyway around my mom I don’t feel like I can be emotional or anything. We have a great relationship but she works a lot because my dad is a dead beat. So I don’t wanna put more stress into her life. I haven’t cried in like two years because I don’t wanna be super depressed because I know once I cry I’m gonna be in a deep depression. I have not many friends because I’m a introvert and I just have no one to talk to. I don’t feel suicidal at all but I just feel like no one should be obligated to listen to me"
174,depression,Don’t ever ask for help,"I’m in the fucking hospital again for the second night. I Litterally called the suicide hotline and now I’m on a 72 hr hold. Fuck them, they don’t care about me. They just want to watch me suffer"
175,depression,My friend told me that she got help because of me today.,"She called me and let me know she talked to her family doctor about her mental health concerns. She did get a diagnosis, and a prescription for medication which she can choose to start. Ever since I got diagnosed in January, I’ve been preaching to every person I know about how easy it is to get help. I was never told any details about the process at the doctors, and it was terrifying. I didn’t have anyone telling me that I didn’t need to invalidate my struggles, and that I didn’t NEED to feel this way all the time. So I took it upon myself to convince my friends with issues that it’s as easy as a check up for a cold. Because it is. It really is. I’m so proud of her, and I’m proud of everyone else who swallowed their pride and fear and sought help. I’m proud of you."
176,depression,Just wanted to share some pieces of my experience with depression,"I'm 28 years old. I can't really recall exactly when all this started but I feel it was around when I was 23. Currently I go through short phases where I have no motivation and a lot of anxiety about seeing people or doing things but its not even close to being as bad as it used to be. I'd say I'm generally happy and am on the right track. When I was in the worst part of my depression it was affecting me physically. My body would ache and it was incredibly hard to move. Just standing up from a seated position was such a chore. I had no motivation to do anything whatsoever. It was so odd. It was like I couldn't perceive color. I could physically see color but it all just felt so gray and I couldn't see the beauty in anything. I read online that I should talk to friends and family about it and let them know what's happening. I'm not discouraging anyone from doing this but for me it was the biggest mistake ever. No one was really receptive or understanding. I got answers that were pretty much ""Why don't you just be happy? You control your own emotions."" Even my girlfriend wasn't supportive. She pretty much told me I didn't actually have depression and that I'm exaggerating. I would say that's when my relationship really started to fall apart because after that I just felt alone. I think it was affecting my immune system because I was getting sick kind of frequently. There were a few times that my friends would call me to see if I wanted to go out and I said I was sick. They would try to peer pressure me but it eventually ended in them being irritated. But the worst one was when I get a call from one of them saying ""You're always sick yeah? Every time we want to do something you're coincidentally sick."" As if to say I was lying about being sick. And then I got a call from the other friend right after that saying almost the exact same thing. I was actually called a ""shitty friend"" on a separate occasion because I didn't want to hang out. I've had bosses get mad at me because my productivity was low as well. My memory was so bad at the time that I would forget tasks that I was just asked to do. On top of that I was struggling with chronic fatigue or whatever it might've been like I mentioned earlier. I wanted to die so badly but I was too afraid to kill myself. That made me even more upset. I used to call myself a bitch for being to afraid to do it. I had a job landscaping at the time and at one point in the day I had to mow a section of grass that was right next to a busy road. Every time I got to that part I would fantasize about a car swerving and hitting me. But every once in a while I would have maybe a portion of the day that I could see the light. I would feel normal for a bit. The feeling was amazing. Colors seemed seemed beautiful, I felt grateful for things, the mountains in the valley were amazing, the wind felt good. I'd become so overwhelmed with these feelings and emotions that I would break down and cry. In those moments I would wonder why I was in such a deep depression. I felt guilty for feeling the way I did. But most importantly it gave me hope that I could fix it and feel that way all the time if I just kept pushing through. My point is that the light at the end of the tunnel is always there even if you can't see it. To everyone out there struggling I wish the best for you and make a promise to yourself that no matter what you won't hurt yourself."
177,depression,No one would want to spend their nights with me.,I'm not in the back of anyone's mind. It hurts a lot.
178,depression,Life just keeps triggering my depressive episodes...,"For the past few years in college everything had been normal, my depression was really bad in high school though because of this one really mentally abusing “friend” I had. But ever since I graduated and started working full time I just feel mentally and physically exhausted all the time. I hate my job, I hate my boss, but finding a new job during Covid is incredibly difficult. I’ve lost interest in art, writing, and games. Depression and anxiety is starting to get the better of me and I don’t know what to do."
179,depression,"My weight is the cause of my depression, but food and alcohol is the only thing that makes me happy.","I barely go outside because I feel like I’m too fat and disgusting for people to even look at me. I don’t even think I’m an ugly person, it’s just the years of abuse of food and booze have turned me unappealing. Hell, I’ve even had girls want to be with me and tell me I’m attractive before. Though, if they saw me now they definitely wouldn’t think that. 
 
It’s a simple fix right? Start eating healthy, work out, and quit drinking. When you have depression those simple daily tasks seem impossible. I’ve gone to therapy, I’ve quit drinking before. Nothing lasts more than a couple months, before I’m back to binging on food and booze. 

I can’t get a job right now because I’m too fucking disgusted at myself for even existing. My mom and dad are the only people in my life, and they should have thrown me on the street a couple years ago, but they have hope I’ll be something someday. I have no friends, nothing to look forward to in my daily life, the only thing that makes me not wanna blow my brains out is eating a nice meal or drinking a bottle of whiskey. I’m so deep into rock bottom I don’t know how I’ll ever get out. It’s not like I’m shooting heroin or smoking crack, I’m addicted to FOOD and alcohol. 

People out there have x10000 worse of a life than me. They struggle every day to get by. Yet I was born on second base and have taken 24 years and I’m still on second base. I’m privileged, I’m loved, my family is here for me. Yet all I can manage to do is feel sorry for myself and want to die. 

I’m sorry that most of you reading this are in a worse situation than me. All I have to do is lose weight and stop isolating myself. Yet I’m so selfish, fat , disgusting and want to end my life because of it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m sorry I can’t be better. 

I genuinely hate myself more than anyone could ever hate me. 

I’m sorry mom, I’m sorry dad."
181,depression,Nobody cares,"I feel so alone, everyone I love leaves me, everyone I care about doesn't care about me. None of my friends are answering me even though they just know I'm really upset.

I should just stop reaching out to people and just give up. 

He doesn't care about me and never will. Nobody does."
182,depression,hi,"i’m just so sad. i know i shouldn’t compare myself to other people but it just happens. i just moved away to college and so did my friends/brother, and i just feel like they have made so many friends and are genuinely having a good experience... i don’t get it am i just an awful person do people not like me or want to talk to me. it’s not fair i try so hard to be nice and meet people but it goes no where so i’m just by myself. when the people around me don’t even try. i guess i just suck so i shouldn’t try anymore right? i’ve been crying for the past few days especially in the  weekends bc i just mope around while my friends and family are having the best times of their life. i’m so happy for them but it’s just not fair it feels like the world is against me and i’m alone. and no i don’t have a roommate anymore bc they moved out due to health reasons (not covid) so i’m really completely all alone. i’m in group chats, have been to social events when planned but have made no actual friends :( just wrote this to vent bc i’m just so sad."
183,depression,Unintended Manipulation?,"Does it ever feel like you are manipulating the people around you? Or even complete strangers?

That’s how I feel writing about this, trying to speak with fellow friends or even thinking about getting actual help. At this moment, every word that I speak or write just feels like a manipulation to another person. If I express feelings of depression, people care. If I show guilt, people forgive. For me, it does not feel real. Not that they forgive or care, but that my words are genuine. 

I don’t want to feel like I’m manipulating everyone around me by expressing myself. 

This goes for everyone here too."
184,depression,All that I did not get to say to you,"I hate you, I thought those three words sums everything up. 

but no, it’s way deeper than hatred, it’s about how you made us, how you made me feel, how you made her feel.

it’s about growing up with you never around, about travelling without telling, about leaving for months with no call, it’s about you putting her and them first.

It’s about not having any good memory. 

It’s about me trying to figure out why I have such commitment issues and yet I realise it now, that growing up you are and were and probably always be the reason why.

It’s about you always playing the victim pretending that she was never the good wife you deserve, yet you deserve shit for walking off months pretending it’s for work and yet you leave us with nothing, no money to eat, shop, bare necessities. 

You say that she was not there,  that she pressures you, that’s not the good wife you want, I say she is good, but you changed her, you turned her into this monster, you think you deserve the world but I think you are a shit of a person and deserve nothing. 

You brought her into our lives, you said she is a client and yet there you are again leaving us and going with her away. 

You always say you don’t have enough funds to send us for vacation or to go for vacation and yet there you are spending all your money on her, on them, jumping from woman to woman, leaving the people that matter behind. 

You say you want a family, I say you deserve to be alone, you deserve to b hurt, cheated on, left alone. 

She blames you for not providing for your family, for us, you say you did an amazing job paying for our school and health but little does he forget that you don’t bring children to life to toss them aside, it is a responsibility. 

When I was 5 years old, your friend Molested me, I wouldn’t want to go to your workplace and yet you insisted. 

When I was 8 years old, you hit the shit out of me because you found a love letter that I love to no one, I was alone, neglected, no parents love. I was 8 years old, what would I know about love and relationships, I was innocent 

When I was 9 years old, you pulled me by the hair and hit me, 3 fractured ribs because I missed taekwondo classes, I was 9 years old, I was alone. 

When I was 10, I wouldn’t go to school because I had a blue eye, my father hit me again because I was 5th in class. 

At 11 it was because I picked skateboarding, not a feminine sports and hanging out with boys. 

At 12 it was because of school, again.

At 13 you did not have to hit me, I tried to kill myself, I wanted to die. What kind of thoughts would go through a 13 years old, someone who saw nothing of life, that would make them want to kill themselves, I laid silently in bed waiting for death, turns out, not enough pills can kill me that day but also I knew that I really don’t want to die. 

By the Age of 14, I had my birthday planned, you promised you’d come and yet again, you were somewhere around the world gallivanting with some woman you just met. 

By the age of 15, I was unhappy, depressed, hearing voices, I opened to my mom, she said it was not big deal, I shrugged it off and slept. 

At 16 I was hospitalised because I cut my veins too deep. It took you two suicide attempts and 16 years old to come see me, but it took me 16 years old to say no. I just went back to my room.

At the age of 18, you hit me in the middle of the streets, because I just graduated high school and I was in the car with my friends listening to music and laughing. 

I am 23 years old, yet I still despise you, I still have a lot to say, a lot I want to scream but I probably would never be able to. 

I still have not moved on, I still cannot have a healthy relationship because whenever I meet a decent guy, I remember all the horrible things you did to her, to me. 

All the fighting, the screaming the hitting... 

I know that some people around the world have it worse,  but that does not make my pain any less real. 

I just want to ask, why would you bring kids to the world, if we are going to undergo a miserable life, why bring kids to life if we’d grow up to want to kill ourselves, so young, so innocent, why take away our innocence.. 

I lost myself in the process

186,depression,I feel physically ill.,"I’ve never felt so exhausted in my entire life. These past few months have been exhausting and physically taxing even though I haven’t done much of anything. I feel like I’m always going to pass out, my limbs are weak, I have constant headaches, shortness of breath, and can hardly get myself out of bed. My cognitive abilities have declined rapidly, so I haven’t been productive whatsoever. It makes me feel so useless. I might as well be dead. It’s infuriating, and I feel that my body is giving out on me. I’m not overweight or have any underlying health issues (that I know of), so it must be mental. I don’t know really. I’m just tired of being here."

190,depression,My first time struggling with depression whilst being happy,"Today marks a month of this bout of depression for me. This week has gotten worse, three nights I haven’t slept at all despite being exhausted, sleeping at night has become so difficult. 

This year I left a decade long relationship in which I felt so alone and unloved. I moved from a remote corner of the country to the city (I’m still interstate from my family and friends but only one flight away now). I got a job that was an amazing opportunity and will be so beneficial to my career. I started studying again and hope to finally finish my degree next year. I met the love of my life and I’m taking control of my physical health which has suffered due to my mental health. I’m finally happy for the first time in years. And then a month ago it hits; I’m crying all the time, avoiding going to work at all costs, not cleaning my apartment or taking care of myself, either eating too much or not enough, giving up on sleeping, just napping when I can. Just showering has become a monumental task that literally leaves me breathless. Honestly it’s been so hard coming to terms with the fact that happiness does not automatically mean I’m  well, which is honestly what I always thought, it’s been.. eye opening. 

My last therapist said I use the idea of suicide as a safety net. So I used to give myself small goals,  “you can’t kill yourself until the last book in this series comes out, or until you finish that game.” The thing that’s keeping me going this time is that I don’t actually feel like I need my safety net anymore, I guess because despite being depressed I’m still.. happy? So I’m trying to focus on the fact that I’m better than I have been in a long time because I’m not even considering suicide as an option. I’m hoping thats what will get me through this, and finally be able to sleep. 

Background: I am medicated and was diagnosed with MDD 13 years ago, I also have a personality disorder and GAD. I have a psychiatrist appointment in 9 days and I’m hoping to change the meds I’ve been on for the last few years."
191,depression,My depression has feeling so stuck lately,"I feel like no matter how hard I try everything just comes around full circle and falls apart, and my depression rebounds and makes it so hard to cope. As soon as I can resolve one issue in my life, two more pop up and I get feeling overwhelmed. 

I used to be so proud of myself- I got promoted at my job, was working hard on my relationships, pursuing opportunities and reaching out to friends. Yesterday my manager gave me some criticism and I had a mental breakdown in the parking lot. I’ve been getting so triggered by anything minor because it just adds into my pile of shit I already can’t deal with. I never make it to my online classes because I started the semester off behind and now I’m already shutting down because I feel like I won’t catch up. 

Lately I just feel like a failure, like everything I do isn’t enough, so I’ve just stopped trying. I sleep like 10-11 hours a day and feel constantly exhausted. I have a Saturday off work today and I’ve wasted it all in bed. I’m supposed to be moving out of my apartment soon (and back into my moms house- which i know will weigh on my mental health but I have no other options) but I can’t even get myself to pack a single box. Sometimes I just feel so dissociated from everything around me that I don’t even know what to do and where to begin. I’m just existing at this point and it’s really painful to watch the rest of the world move forward while I am struggling so much. 

I’ve been seeing my therapist weekly/biweekly but I feel like I should get back on medication- which I really don’t want to do. Antidepressants always make me feel so numb and lifeless, I don’t want to numb my sadness I want to resolve it and move forward. I just don’t know how or what to do. I can’t even prioritize anything at the moment because I am so overwhelmed. I wish I could just hit a reset button."
192,depression,Different,"I’ve written on here twice which seemed to help temporarily. Just letting out all my thoughts, not bottling it up until I explode. It’s hard to function most days and nights. It’s difficult to function at work. I’ve been having this feeling of numbness,emotionally. I recently got promoted and I’m not as happy as I should be. My best friend just got engaged and I’m not as excited and happy as I should be. More like I want to be. I want to be happy and excited but my brain is not letting me. Now I’ve been to therapy pretty much my entire life and it doesn’t seem to help. I was also on meds for most of my life up until 2 years ago because they were not working. I told my doctor the pills weren’t working and they didn’t listen so I stopped cold turkey. I went through withdrawals but it wasn’t bad. My last therapist didn’t believe in meds that all I had to do is train my brain to not think like I did, still do. I’m not voluntarily thinking these thoughts. I’m not making myself this way on purpose. She made me feel like I was crazy. Made me feel like I chose to feel like this, that I had a choice. Told me that depression and anxiety was a taught behavior. Yes, mental illness runs on both side of my family. Every illness really depression, anxiety, bipolar, manic depression, Schizophrenia,and multiple personality disorder.I’m sure there is more. I never met or grew up with majority of the family that has these diseases. I believe they’re diseases not just an “illness”. But she told me addiction is hereditary not a taught behavior. Anyways I don’t see her anymore not in a year or so. I think this is what rock bottom feels like at least for me it does. I’ve been angry a lot lately. Not at a particular person or situation just angry. I used to be sad but now I’m starting to feel nothing. That’s scaring me because I’m realizing that it’s winning. My depression is finally starting to take over me and I’m ready to give in. I’m ready to take all the pills I have in my night stand to end it all. I’m ready to give up because I’ve fought for so long that I can’t do it anymore. At least I knew before this I didn’t want to die because I felt everything. I was sad, I would cry, I would talk about my feelings,when I have the dark thoughts i would feel something. Now I don’t, I feel absolutely nothing. It’s like I forgot how to be human. I don’t know how to react to things anymore. I feel weird, I’ve been depressed since I was 7 now I’m 25 so to feel like this is different. I feel like I don’t have control anymore, like I’m on autopilot. I feel I shouldn’t be here, like I’m not supposed to be here. I feel strange."
193,depression,Depressive cycles?,"I know that for most people depression comes and goes in waves, but how long do episodes last for you all? I have had major seasons of depression in my life (months, even years) but sometimes it will be for a couple days or a week. Does anyone else experience these shorter episodes?"
194,depression,why does nobody like me?,so i need some help. so i play video games online. and i also have a disability called autism. so i am a bit weird when it comes to talking to people. although i want friends. but it seems they dont want me. a recent experience has me feeling so depressed. so about two weeks ago i met this guy that does youtube. i commented on his video saying that i liked it. then i asked if he would want to play with me. he said yes. so we played and i had so much fun. let me give you some backstory. it has been so long since i had a friend to play online with. like over a year. i have had many friends in the past. i was even a leader of a group. but nowadays everyone seems to hate me. so i kept playing with this guy. and he helped me get something i needed too. then  a couple days ago we were playing then he was getting mad because there were afk players. then he just left. i did not say anything or do anything to him. before then we were having a good time. then i come online later that day and see that he is off my friends list. and i messaged him and asked why he deleted me. no response. so i went on his channel and asked the same thing. and once again no response. so at this point i was hurt and angry. i kept wondering why he did that. and i still have no idea why. just today he did a stream so i asked him again. and still no response. i think he blocked me. so im very upset right nor. a mixture of sadness and anger. i know it might seem weird that i kept messaging him. but i wanted to know why he did that. if i knew what i did that made him treat me like that. i would at least feel a little better. but him ignoring me hurts like hell. i know its stupid that im so upset about losing a online friend. but i have no other friends. it was so great to enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played. instead of just playing solo. so i want to know. why do you think he deleted me? he never showed any signs of not liking me. or being mad at me.
195,depression,Beyond depressed,"My fiancé is currently incarcerated, has 10 years. He recently was diagnosed with Leukemia. I’ve tried getting him out but it was just denied. I’m at a loss. Idk what to do anymore. I’m beyond broken and devastated. I feel helpless and hopeless ):"
196,depression,Im sorry,TW VENT: Im sorry. Im sorry for existing and for being a burden. Im sorry i didnt kms yet. I deserved to. Im sorry for everything. To my friends and family- im sorry for being an inconvenience. To my bullies- im sorry you took the time to interact with me. Im worthless. And you all know it.
197,depression,I’ve been abandoned by multiple people I’ve met online over a long period,"I’m too toxic so no one stays, I’m ugly and uninteresting and I’m lonely.

There’s nothing I can do to improve my life, I just want it all to end now.

There’s no reason to go on"
198,depression,The irony of masks,"I’ve gone through 14 years of pretending normalcy (diagnosed at 11, a diagnosis my parents ignore to this day 😊) and the mask requirement is a cruel joke, but also wrapped in some irony. Just something I was thinking about."
199,depression,No one cares,Yeah I’m pretty sick of caring about people and wanting to be there for them and dropping everything for them just to get jack sh*t in return. F*ck you. I say I’m struggling and no one gives a sh*t but let me be there for you. I’m done
200,depression,Pretty sure my only friend I really had doesn't like me anymore :/,"I dont know what I did but my best friend and i fell out of contact and he stopped asking me to come over when he was having people over. This was close to the beginning of the pandemic. I messaged him tonight apologizing for being distant and said I missed him. He said basically it's fine and then had to go and said ""catch up with you soon"" never said he missed me or asked how I was. Maybe he was tired. But hes the only person I had to hang out with for 4 years other than my partner. I dont know how I messed up but I feel like a shut in because he doesn't care about me anymore and I dont get out except to see my grandma.

I dont know what I wanted to get out of this post, just had to tell someone because obviously I dont really have anyone to tell"
201,depression,It’s all coming back again,"The doubt, the fear, the sadness, it’s all coming back AGAIN. And it’s not even like life is bad, I just have these feelings swelling up inside of me again. I was doing so well too but not it feels like it’s all going down the drain, all the hard work I’ve done is being washed away. I don’t want to go back to the way it was before, but I’ve been done this road and I know how it ends.

If you read this, I thank you for sharing your time, idk why I come to post here but I do. Maybe it’s because I don’t want anyone to be like me, maybe it’s because I want all of you to get better and be the happiest you can be. I don’t even know what I’m saying anymore but I hope at least someone will. Hope you all have a great day."
202,depression,Would you rather....,"would you rather have crippling anxiety that makes you want to run away in every interaction..... or 

Take drugs that numb your anxiety that you feel unable to feela awkward that you are awkward about not feeling awkward and 5 x more depressed. 


You can onlu pick one.  Welcome to my living existence!  Have fun!"
203,depression,Is it just me or people do cry themselves out to sleep at night,"First of all depression gives me a high level of anxiety, and especially at nights it really becomes difficult to control the thought, makes it so difficult to sleep. So I just built a habit of crying out; letting out the feelings in silence for just a moment. And I admit, after it becomes easier to fall asleep."
204,depression,Do psych wards help?,I’ve been thinking a lot about admitting myself to a psych ward but I’ve only heard bad things about those places. Has this ever actually helped anyone?
205,depression,Bad time. Saved by the puke.,My cat puking on the floor just stopped me from............. cuz I thought.. who's gonna clean that?
206,depression,Advice for long term MDD,"I was wondering whether anyone could help me in some way or another, 

I am 28 going on 29; and am experiencing a long term major depressive episode that has lasted since around March (pretty much when the pandemic hit.) I am not in anyway a danger to myself per se as I have experienced MDD episodes since I was around 14 or so and generally I've learnt to live with it as medication is categorically not an option. In February I lost my job as an IT administrator with a decent salary and haven't been able to find work since;   
despite job hunting on a daily basis for an average of 6 hours a day (I tend to stick to a fairly rigid schedule work wise) there are a number of reasons for this as far as I can see - 1) I live with folks/brothers (who I honestly find intolerable as our views conflict considerably) and it's in a terrible location. 2) Whilst this isn't an attempt to scapegoat I am disabled and don't drive. Having burnt through all my savings by the end of May I am now effectively destitute on the basis that I am surviving on £100 p/m. On top of this two weeks ago my long term long-distance girlfriend of 7 years broke up with me as I was apparently too difficult to deal with and I was unable to pay her rent - simply because I need to eat (longstanding arrangement that I was broadly OK with in the past) at this point if I'm honest it's somewhere between numb and agony. However trying to be proactive and positive; since March I have been studying in the evenings/weekends; and have taught myself Web/Software development and taken a few professional certs; created a portfolio of work and attached this to my resume whilst at the same time trying local freelancing. Its frustrating because I am not wasting time and sitting watching TV or anything like that. Its just that at this point I am at a total loss as to what to do. I met a friend today and she gave me £30 for a haircut unprompted because the last one was in early Feb and honestly it just totally broke me. Not only the fact that she gave me the money but honestly because £30 seems like an absurdly large sum of money at this point . I have found myself smoking around 30-40 a day (bulk brought from a vacation in January) which would suggest I'm in a very dark place as whilst I smoke normally it's around 3-4 a day tops. In terms of apply for jobs outside my sector I am quite limited in terms of my abilities (prior to the pandemic I took a job at the golden arches and honestly found it openly degrading - not because it was fast food at all but due to having Cerebral Palsy I physically wasn't able to maintain the speed required to work in the kitchen/counter areas and either worked on the drive thru window or simply mopped the floor) I live in a rural area so whilst there are jobs available picking and packing veg or working in a supermarket I am simply not fast enough to do so (prior experience). I think the most disarming part of this is the fact that I recognise that I need a specific type of therapy and that's the main motivation at this point for finding a job. Honestly at this point things are a fucking mess and truthfully I have no idea what else to do in order to change the situation as at this point it feels like a hopeless downward spiral; not least in terms of the work but as my friend put it ""it's like there's too much low level stress for you to enjoy anything;"" which has honestly been the case for the past four years. I need to find a way of pulling myself out of this mess but I am honestly completely out of ideas on how to get my head right at this point - I attempt to exercise read/write etc. but currently the only thing that's keeping me sane at this point is binge-watching things like Brooklyn99/Daria/Parks and Rec - as I can't focus on anything with a coherent plot at this point - another friend pointed out that this was a symptom of a MDE. If anyone at all has any advice on something I could do to change the situation I would really appreciate it."
207,depression,I really want to die,"I have no intent, if anything I am living purely for one purpose, my boyfriend who needs me. Despite that, I still feel pathetic and like a lost cause. I can barely get out of bed anymore to even just use the bathroom. When I get back upstairs from using the bathroom I just collapse in bed breathing heavy and wanting to break down crying. My room is a bug infested junk pile that I can't for the life of me keep clean. Therapy doesn't help me. My psychiatrist thinks a literal hypertension medicine is a good move for my diagnosis of ""severe depression"" when I'm 19 and I get dizzy spells as it is. Dying always seems like such a good way out. Sorry I just need to vent, I feel so pathetic not being able to go to the bathroom cause I'm too sad."
208,depression,Why is this world so selfish?,"I want it to stop. Just everything. I don't want to be me anymore. 
Sometimes it feels like my body, this surface is the only thing that is there of me. He tries to appear happy. But I break in there and nobody notices. How can that be? Why is this world so selfish? There is no one there. 
These words, these feelings were pulled into the mud by society and ridiculed!  I can understand why no one is talking. How then? As soon as words like suicide, depression appear, everyone thinks of any b/w pictures with sad sayings like, I smile because I have to.  Happy on the outside and broken on the inside.’ And nobody wants to understand what it really means. 
Yes, I was like that and nobody was interested!  You are trying to give such obvious signs and people recognize them and don't act. Because they are scared? Are you scared? I dont know.  But I'm also scared. I am scared of myself. I am afraid of my thoughts. I'm afraid that one of you will find me dead on the floor. Do you know how that feels? There's this empty pain, It feels like you're crying without your eyes crying.  It's that dull pain of loss. I do not want that."
209,depression,Away,"Loneliness. Relatable for most people, due to quarantine, right? It's hard, you don't go to school, work, and just see people for no greater reason. But it shouldn't be that bad, should it? Everyone must have friends, they must talk over the internet, and play online games, and it must not be that bad, right? 

And it should go like this for me too, because i had friends, i had best friends, i liked someone in a romantic way, i was often sad, but that time, i was often happy too. Right now i don't know if i have friends, they're suposed to talk to you, right? Am i the only one with best friends who haven't talk to you in weeks? Do people leave you without a proper reason and lie? Do you wanna die? Or do you wanna do nothing because you won't do anything, you can't do anything and no one else will do anything because no one cares. And you just do nothing, there's nothing else to do, you feel so, so empty and sad, but no one cares, and there's nothing you can do. So you go on and watch something, go away for some time, and you just stay there because everything is bad, but at sometime, that feeling will go away too, everything good just fade, feels like my stomach is cold and being pressed. Nothing is good, everything is bad, you're alone, no one cares, and there's nothing you can do. Loneliness, duty, overwhelm, sadness, emptiness, broke, heavy, tired, down, me.

No one cares.

Friends, love, good. It all goes away, you're alone."
210,depression,Feeling really low right now,just feel like no matter what I do there is just to many things around me for me to block out the bad. I release stress and emotions by running but im to tired now. So much bad things in the past two days that today I've ran a total of 18 miles. Its like there is nothing for me anymore
211,depression,this is gonna sound very selfish and weird but,sometimes i wish more people around me would start having depression and anxiety or atleast the ones who already have them to be more vocal about it so that I wont feel alone?does this make sense?
212,depression,Thoughts on wrapping things up and leaving.,"In the last few months, potentially covid WFH related, potentially relationships and love related, I’ve been feeling extremely down. Initially it was the kind of depression where I felt my self esteem drop through the floor, I felt uglier, more unattractive, unappealing, more pathetic and unnecessary than ever. I was crying almost every night not about anything in particular really just feeling down. 

I have a great job that pays well, I work from home, share an apartment with a beautiful, intelligent and interesting person that keeps it well decorated and tidy, I have a small gathering of friends that are social, happy, well adjusted people that are intelligent and interesting and helpful when needed. I have a guy I’m seeing, we’re just friends that are exclusive but he isn’t in love with me in that way, which is fine, his company is comforting and I’m happy when I spend time with him. My family is small but happy my parents are in love and together and my sister is in love with her partner. Nothing traumatic or awful have ever happened to me to warrant feelings of sadness. Anyone, even myself included would tell me I have zero things wrong in my life and am very privileged and happy. I have some financial constraints that have been upsetting me with credit cards and loans but nothing so unmanageable that it’s crippling even though sometimes it can feel that way.

But there’s been just something about my life at the moment that makes me genuinely feel absolutely nothing. I feel nothing for my current self and nothing for the future. I thought briefly maybe if I get my debt under control I would be happier, but would I really? It will just come up again, car loans, mortgages, saving endlessly, it’s a cycle which is also fine. I think about things that I think I want in the future and they only really make me marginally happier. Nothing is that interesting or compelling to me anymore. I have nothing tying me to this planet, to this reality. I remember once a few weeks ago thinking that nobody had messaged me for five days that wasn’t work related. It feels like this world is kind of like a busy bustling happy room that I could obviously take part in and be busy but I could really also just leave, just wrap things up financially, personal belongings boxed up and the just leave the room. People will notice and perhaps be sad and my family will grieve, but they have so much love in their lives that it would just be that momentary, passing grief but they have each other and it will pass like everything else does.

There is a place called The Gap where I would want to go when the time is right. I’d make sure I’ve got all my stuff packed, moved out of my place, use the time at home to get my debt in some order which should hopefully only take 2-3 months, I’ve organised my sister as my beneficiary, and will try to save enough to give my family some cash. It’s kind of funny the more self help books I read and more meditative audio content I listen to, the more okay I begin to feel about my decision to commit suicide. I don’t have bad or emotional feelings about it anymore, it’s just an emptiness, very nothing feeling and I’m not sure if it will go away or if this is really it. I think it will be okay."
213,depression,My depression has become severe enough I can't function,"I moved back home with my father and I can't handle it anymore. My life stressors are too much, and it's been killing me. Between physical disabilities, multiple surgeries, losing my job and being denied unemployment... The list goes on. I had a couple very awkward moments with my father since we've been living in close quarters and he's retired, and we spend every waking second in the same house. It was no big deal until I started taking an SSRI that fried my brain and made me want to kill myself. I got off of it after talking to my psychiatrist but I haven't been the same since. I have no personality, or at least it's not how it used to be. I'm irritable all the time, lazy, and just don't care about anything.

Worse yet, my depression has gotten to a point where I can no longer function. I can't work even if I found a job. I can't sleep when I need to, and when I do I sleep for 10+ hours at a time. I sleep through my alarms. I can't talk to anyone. I can't socialize whatsoever. I haven't really left my house much since April due to COVID + disabilities. Everywhere here is a hot spot and my dad is older and at risk. I feel like I'm in prison.

Today I haven't eaten and it's 3pm. I spent the entire day in my bed afraid of getting up and having to talk to my dad because I feel an intense need to talk about everything on my mind, but it's destroying our relationship. I've been obsessing over awkward encounters we've had and other things from my past and unable to stop it. Meditating, breathing exercises, learning new hobbies or engaging in ones I used to like, watching movies or TV shows, reading, talking to any friends, you name it: at best it doesn't help, at worst it makes things do much more severe I start shaking. I can't do anything anymore. I used to fly aircraft and had job offers in the 6 figure range, committed relationship, my own home, everything. And it's all just... gone. 90% of it is not my fault or is because of my medical issues and stuff, and the parts that are my fault are because I self sabotage all the time now. It's like I'm a whole new, lesser person for no reason.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I just can't take it anymore."
214,depression,It came back, The memories came back hitting me again. I want to focus on my new relationship thinking it would forget about her... now I'm feeling regrets and back into my suicidal state. Just seeing her happy makes my heart stopped and I even told myself to move forward but how can I. My life is getting worse and worse.
215,depression,i should’ve died two years ago. i wish i had.,"back in my sophomore year of high school i crashed my car into a 5 foot ditch on the way back from my ex’s house (fucking dumb ik). when the lights turned on, i was perfectly calm. I got out of the car, climbed my way up, and called for my mom without any panic in my voice and went back home. the next day, i was told if i had swerved a few feet to my left, i would’ve landed in a 10 foot ditch and probably would’ve died. 

throughout most of my life, i’ve felt as if i’ve had depression (i’ve never gotten help so i don’t know), and every time i have an episode, i just look back and wish how i should’ve landed in the deeper ditch. i hate pain, and i can’t bring myself to inflict pain when committing suicide because i’m a failure. for me to die, it’d have to be completely out of my control or i’d have to spend a ton of money on a carbon monoxide tank. since i can’t do either, i just cry and think about how much better it’d be if i would’ve died back then."
216,depression,meds make me nauseous,"im on 10mg buspar, 150 wellbutrin, and 100 pristiq. within 5-10 minutes they hit and i feel super mad nauseous and dizzy and lightheaded. i tried taking them at night so that i can be dizzy in bed and hopefully sleep through the nausea, but it can keep me up and i still feel sick in the morning. if i take them during the day around the first time i eat i'm still just nauseous all day and will probably throw up, and i feel too lightheaded to do shit. over time this has made my appetite nonexistent as i feel too sick to eat, but i would probably feel better if i ate, but i also could throw it up. i'm eating one meager meal a day, sometimes two. i can't stomach more than half a sandwich or one taco and some rice. i know i need to talk to my psych about it, her suggestion last time was switching up when i take them but it hasnt worked. until i can get ahold of her again, what can i do to curb the nausea? anyone have similar issues? i'm dreading taking them because its so uncomfortable ugggghh help please lol."
217,depression,Sm1 please read,"Im so desperate for love

A girl kept winking and looking at me while I was out tonight

Then she makes out with a guy I am friends with

What the fuck why am i never good enough
Why do I want wjat i csnt have? I wanted it man but thsts still an issue

Am drunk af imma pass out in bed soon when i get home but fk ne i might visit the trsim tracks
Bye"
218,depression,Im lost,"I always have this little voice in my head telling me the worse stuff about me or the worse things that could/can happen. I try to push it away and focus on the good but it..gets the best of me.
Idk what to call this feeling since Ive never really had a doctor tell me ""hey, you're depressed"" but I always have that voice in my head, have this empty feeling with the reoccurring thought of ""whats the point of even being here..oh yeah, my parents"". I dont feel like doing anything, I have no energy nor motivation to do the simplest things like getting out of bed and brushing my teeth or feeding myself.
Currently right now, my admission to school is kicking my ass. There's a possibility itll be terminated and if that happens...I don't think I'll have the energy to do anything.
Maybe Im being overdramatic...i just wish i can stop overthinking and just feeling down all the time, i just want to feel okay at least"
219,depression,How Do I Know If I’m Having Suicidal Thoughts?,"Who amongst us hasn’t been driving and casually thought at some point “what if I just drove into the center divider right now?” but with no actual intention of doing so, right? Is that considered a suicidal thought?

But lately things have just been bad. I know they’ve been bad for everyone. Everything’s just bad. I feel like I’ve lived my life with relentless optimism and hope but it’s always just one thing after another, an unsafe household to a safe but unhealthy one, a break up, lease ends and despite searching can’t find a new place to live, forced to give up my cat who was the only “person” I had, a government-shutdown, getting promptly from terminated from a job I was able to secure (and was excelling at) since I didn’t know when my original place of work would be open, transient and drug-dependent mother has a heart attack. I can’t claw my way out of poverty even when things were open and I was working 2 skilled jobs, 7 days a week. I can’t create or maintain friendships or relationships, I can’t sleep, I rarely have an appetite anymore, and I can’t afford the help I clearly need. Everyone around me has partners, supportive friends, and I’ve tried for years to build myself a life I could be proud of and I know I’ve worked really hard but here I am at 27 living in a storage room at my parents’ house and the only jobs I can get (but haven’t gotten so far) are minimum wage

And now I’m really thinking about how I would go about it. I don’t really think I’ll go through with it, but even I notice the pattern of thinking has shifted.

I don’t know. It’s like no one will take me seriously unless I’m actively suicidal but at that point it’s be too late."
220,depression,I wanna spam a bunch of random people I've never met and tell them my shit cuz I'm too afraid to message anyone I know in real life,I went through my contacts and I thought about all the people I know and even have talked to about how I feel before but it feels stupid. Today I went for a walk with my pastor for counselling and I'm even too scared to message my pastor. My husband and dad are downstairs doing renos but I cant seem to tell them. I want to scream everything to the whole world but I cant even message a good friend that I'm having a hard time processing my diagnosis of ptsd and mdd. It's not like people dont know. Lots of people have told me they are here for me and here to listen but I usually just try to make them feel better about whatever shit or overstated advice they are giving me so they dont feel bad having a conversation with me. I feel horrible guilty all the time because I'm needing to hide away in my room all the time but I also so desperately want to be with people and have fun. This is hard.
221,depression,Things have been horrible lately...,I feel like I’m going to relapse any day now.. I’m trapped in my own head because of course my so called girlfriend doesn’t know how to communicate. Sometimes I wish I never put myself or my feelings out there. Will she ever see wtf I’m going through probably not. One sided relationship smh I really need to just let her go but then I think how long would not talking to her last..... I hate being in love with her otherwise I would be gone a long time ago 🤦🏽‍♂️ it’s seriously a lose lose situation at this point. If I remain here jumping through hoops I’m most likely going to lose my mind but on the other hand if I stop talking to her I’m most likely going to lose my mind. She’s my best friend that I tell everything to but I’m over the feeling of not mattering to her. It’s a messed up situation. Fuck you love for making me weak!
222,depression,No sé qué hacer con mi vida. En verdad me odio a mí mismo mucho que soy un perdedor sin motivación ni confidencia.,"Soy un perdedor y un pendejo. Con el tiempo, se nota que no ya tengo buena memoria, ni tengo el amor/el pasión de vida, ni puedo pensar bien y tan rápido como antes.

Parece que nunca me voy a cambiar. Nunca voy a aprender mis lecciones, y nunca voy a mejorarme. Es un ciclo voraz. Me odio a mí mismo porque jamás cambio, y jamás cambio por no tengo la motivación ni la confidencia ni auto-respeto a debido de mi auto-odio.

No tengo idea de lo que realmente quiero ya. No quiero decepcionar a mi familia, pero siento como no puedo hacer nada. Ya me he decepcionado a mí, durante mucho tiempo. Desde la secundaria. También desde entonces, me he aislado de todos mis amigos reales (online jangueo con unas personas a veces, pero nadie más). No quiero enseñar mi cara por ningún lado.

Escuela siempre ha sido lo más importante para mí, obviamente aparte de mi familia. Pero, a pesar de eso, siempre fracaso. Cada vez, parece. Y así, llego a odiarme más y más. No puedo concentrarme, no puedo sacar buenas notas seguramente, no tengo talentos fuera de la escuela, etc. 

Y ahora no tengo las ganas de intentar, simplemente me temo que fracasaré otra vez. 

Sé que a mí me ama mi familia siempre va a ser así, aunque por supuesto todavía puedo decepcionar, pero no sé si puedo realmente amarme a mí. 

No tengo nadie con quien hablar. Creo que necesito ver un terapista otra vez pero no sé quién ni cuando. La escuela ya está empezando y no sé qué hacer. No quiero perderla pero al mismo tiempo no quiero fracasar de nuevo.

¿Hay alguien que me pueda ayudar y hablar?

Gracias..."
223,depression,Do We Truly Recover From Depression?,"I used to be severely depressed since highschool, so much so that I have little memory of the past aside from feeling absolutely awful and locking myself in my room. Things didn’t really become better afterwards. I’m 19 now, and depression wasn’t really the main focus for a while as it had seemed to have come and go. For a moment, I did enjoy doing things. I was passionate for doing so many things, but perhaps, those were the so-called points of elevation before I succumb back into my bed, and lose my will to move. Maintained weight by overeating at one time, and undereating during others, and hair started falling off. Got into delusions of grandeur, and thought I could do anything but faced reality and so how hopeless I was, which was a fact regurgitated. Always battling to find a middle ground between my well-being and my demons because at some point, i thought embracing it, but i never remember what I stick to, and writing down on journals become a chore because of my ocd. I feel awful. Nothing matters, I don’t matter, yet i have to live on in this world for the sake of what? Some say since there is no purpose, you can do anything. That’s right. I wish I could do anything, but I can’t. Can’t afford a therapist. Trapped. Locked. Fucked. Depression has arisen, and yet, I’m not sure if I’m even depressed. Everything is evil, and deceptive. Especially myself.

edit: my failing memory doesn’t even help, but worsen my circumstance. reading is difficult. Only music seem to be the only thing that keeps me alive. Nothing else."
224,depression,So depressed I gave myself a seizure?,"The last time my depression was so low, I tried to kill myself. I ain't doing that again, but my depression hit an all time low just now from an accumulation of things, and I think it caused some sort of seizure. Is that possible? Previously, my one and only seizure happened when I was in the hospital and they were pumping my stomach after an overdose.

Here's what happened: I was crying. Hard. Harder than I ever have in my life. And every molecule of my being was focused on willing myself to cease existing. I started hyperventilating and I couldn't breath. Suddenly, my arms and legs seized up. My whole body felt like pins and needles and my limbs and hands felt like there was immense pressure in them and they were going to explode, like they were made of bubble wrap. My hands unwillingly curled into claws, and my back felt weird.

It scared me so much I stopped crying and focused on breathing normally. It was painful, whatever happened, and it lasted 4 minutes.

I'm actually glad it happened. It distracted me from my soul-sucking misery. But now I'm curious. Has anyone else experienced this?

In any case, I'm calling my doctor on Monday. My anti-depressants are not working anymore.

Tl;dr I (27f) think I had some sort of seizure after a severe episode of depression."
225,depression,Finished a project but still sad,I worked today on creating a custom drawer liner with cutouts for wrenches that I have and got it done today and while I’m proud I saw that through to completion I’m still really down. I don’t really remember what it’s like to be truly happy with not a care in the world.  It’s been so long. Wish I could get a real hug or even a cuddle. That would be nice
227,depression,It’s coming back and I’m scared,I really thought everything is better now but for the past few days I’ve been so depressed that I can’t do anything productive. I don’t know what to do. My anxiety is getting worse too. I just moved out for college and I don’t know anyone here and I really don’t want my family to know. Why can’t i be normal
228,depression,I’m going cold turkey on my antidepressant,"Recently there’s been a lot going on and I realized I don’t deserve happiness or to be on medication. Today was my first day without it and I feel like shit, but I’m ok cuz I like feeling like it. Fuck the antidepressants who need em I’ll be just fine without em."
229,depression,I just need to say it to some one atleast once.,"Hi! My names Caleb. I'm the tobacco state of North Carolina. I am 23. I grew up in a lower middle class family. My parents divorced when I was 4. My fathet had been very abusive and he has never been back since.
My mom married my step father when I was 8. I'll be honest I was still happy then. Sure I wasn't the popular kid and was bullied but for the most part I was still ok. I was still overall happy. Around that time I was curious and tried crossdressing for the first time in secret of course because my family has always been deeply religious and i knew it wouldnt be met with a good response. So I did and secret and has become something I do often still to this day. 
Skip till I was 17 and I was still happy I had went through moments of feelng hopeless but still overall I was happy. I had always wanted to be in the military so I did Jrotc in high school and had pretty much maped my life out. I wanted to join the navy to be a corp man. Thought enough people were doing the shooting why not be someone trying to do some healing. But I had decided to try and go to college first but it didnt work out as I didn't get any scholarships or grants. My parents aren't rich so they couldn't just pay for me (they had student debt of their own) but made enough that I only got 200 dollars for my Pale grant. So I decided to just go enlisted but I had gained some weight in the time so I had to lose it and got a job in the meantime. At 18 I had a seizure an hour in a shift at work. 
After that seizure alot changed. I lost that job because I was told to just reapply after I got checked out but was told they wouldnt hire me afterwards. I couldn't join the military anymore. So I just worked for the time being till I could found out what I wanted to do(still haven't). 
At 20 I met a women and we got married we found out she was two weeks pregnant when we were three week married. We were happy. On June 18 2018. Elizabeth was born at 30 weeks. She was beautiful and amazing. For a premie she was strong and a fighter. After a month and some change she left the NICU and came home. I was working and things were great happy marriage happy father and Bill's paid. 
On the morning of September 20 2018 I got home from work and since I worked second and we ate and my wife laid down with Elizabeth to sleep at about 12:30ish. I stayed up watching TV for about two hours. They were on the couch. I went over to tell her we needed to move to the bedroom to go to bed and I saw that Elizabeth was white. Not blue not purple white. Pale like she had never seen sunlight. My wife called 911 I started CPR. Blood started coming out of her nose. The police got there and took over then the first responders and then the ambulance. They worked on her for a little in the back and then took off to the hospital. We followed behind. We got there and waited for what seemed like hours and they came and got us and told us she had died. We cried our hearts out and held her body throughout the next day I left about 12:30pm because I'm epileptic and hadn't slept. She was waiting for her mom to come down from Virginia so she could see her. I went to a friends since we dodnt want to stay in that house and she later came and got me and we stayed at her dad's and then my parents for a little while before going back. 
By September of 2019 we were a wreck. Financial, emotionally the whole nine yards. I had tried to exchange sex for money to try and pay Bill's. She wasnt happy about it. But after a while said she had moved on. We had tried and failed at having another child. So in September of 2019 it was me her and a friend from school living together. I was working at a job that was out of town 4 days a week and came home on the 5th. She said she was ok with this and not longer after told me she wanted to move on that she was sleeping with that friend. She told me that on September the 13th of 2019. She told me she stopped loving me the day I walked out of the hospital when Elizabeth passed.
I haven't regrouped since then. Shes has had a miscarriage with him. But shes happier with him. I haven't even had sex since. My health has got worse so I'm out of work. She and he pay the bills while I get high(pot) or drunk if i can convince someone to get me either or. I just feel like a loser and a failure and a freak. My head feels like it is going to explode sometimes. I've loaded my gun so many times. But I'm to much of a pussy to ever go through. I just needed someone to know. I dont want to die but I dont want live anymore."
230,depression,Friends Ugh,"I don’t have any best friends, I have friends... just none that would see my messages as important. Or answer my calls... or hangout all the time. I had a girlfriend and we would hangout so much, I felt happy. We broke up because she caused issues with her BPD, and I don’t want to hangout with her. So I tried to make some online friends, and add people on instagram etc. I found out that I scare people and haven’t met anyone that actually enjoys my company. It’s pretty devastating, getting kicked from discord servers, or getting left on read by 20+ people. I wish I could be happy, but I’m just so fucking lonely. I also wish I wasn’t so impulsive when talking, I make too many inappropriate jokes, or accidentally reveal my crippling mental health. Yikes."
231,depression,My life is an endless repetition of disappointment and no more.,"I’m just another redditor in the seas of depressed. Writing something that little will see.
I don’t see any reason to keep doing this, my life has no genuine fun, no genuine love, no appreciation.
Everything I do makes me believe in myself less and less. My grades from middle to now junior of high school went from As to Bs to Cs to Ds. I study 3 hours a day and do all of my homework just to get graded on public speaking skills and busywork when I’m nearly sleepless in the morning despite getting 90th percentile on standardized tests.

All of my hobbies have just made my self-esteem worse. I want to learn languages but my memory is bad. I want to get really good at video games but my reaction times and problem solving is bad. I want to learn to code, but I’m dumb and can’t even decide where to start with ADD making me switch from language to language within days and dropping hobbies or picking it back up every few weeks. I’ve tried to play instruments, I have bad hand eye coordination and my lungs are weak, I also can’t read music well because I’m stupid.

I have no friends, no appreciative family besides my mom, who I see 20 minutes a day.
My dad doesn’t believe in mental health and says therapists just want me to get addicted to pills. My teachers misunderstand me when I ask for mental help.  Besides how do I know the help will do anything at this point. Even if I get prescribed some shit I’m still gonna be a failure with the illusion that my brain is happy, when my being isn’t. And besides I will get constantly judges by my peers and my family if I do so.

I want love in life, I want people who make things fun, I genuinely don’t think I would ever consider myself generally happy since around 3rd or 4th grade. Have not had any mutual and real friends since then or at least middle school. Why would anyone want to be around a sad sack of shit who has no notable qualities?
Another week goes by and I wonder how long I can take this. When does it become too much? Will things ever actually change for the better or is that something the schools and corporation say to avoid lawsuits of mental illness? I feel like a speck to the world, it passes by me, and there is no real reason I am here."
232,depression,My thoughts,"Burning all my bridges with people make it easier to think about not being around anymore. I go around with alot of pity for myself but I honestly feel if I was not around people would be happier. I'm not gonna win at this game of life, just tired of playing"
233,depression,2020 isn’t my worst year?,"I have childhood trauma and have been depressed since the age of ten. 2020 has given me a lot of downs and I would I say I feel more numb than anything. This isn’t the worse I’ve been through tho. I guess I feel bad that I’m not extremely depressed compared to other years (still very much suffering) makes me feel bad? 
But then again, when I was suffering, the world kept going and thus I will keep going as the world is suffering now."
234,depression,I’m tired of blaming my father’s actions on his childhood trauma,"If he wanted to fix it he would’ve tried , thanks to him , I got fucked up."
235,depression,I miss my dead friends and how things use to be.,"I've been crying on and off all day today. Had my best friend commit suicide 5 years ago, and have lost a handful more to suicide or drugs. I used to be more open with people. I changed after all of the deaths. It's hard to be close to people when the ones closest to you go away. 5 days before my best friend committed suicide I attempted. Depression is just the worst and I honestly don't wish this on anybody. I want to just go away. I hate being in pain."
236,depression,Am I suppose to feel traumatized,"I'm a 17 year old male and when I was younger around 5-8 my older cousin made me give him oral and I threw up. The reason I don't know my age is because my memory of the event is foggy. But i don't know if I necessarily feel traumatized by it. I recently told my therapist and she keeps asking me questions that I should know but don't know how to answer like ""How did it make you feel?"" ""Did you like it?"" ""Does it keep you up at night?"" But the truth is I don't know. I don't know how it makes me feel I don't really feel a whole lot anymore. I wrote a post here about a week ago and people kept telling me to tell my therapist but I kinda regret it. Yeah I guess it feels good to tell someone about it but thats about it. Talking about it don't feel good and remembering it doesn't either. I don't know if I feel traumatized but I feel like I should be. No normal kid has experienced something like that and not feel traumatized by it. Yet I forgot about it and suppressed it so long ago that I don't really feel traumatized. Sorry for this messy long post I just don't know what to do anymore. I have therapy tommrow and don't feel like going anymore kinda feel like giving up."
237,depression,Lyrics by my 13 y/o self,"I was browsing through my phone files when I found an old songtext that was written at the time I had depression. What do you guys think of it?


Dear friends and family

Sorry that I didn't drop too many signs,
the only thing I left behind is this letter of my final rhymes.

50 lies a day but it always goes the same: Yes, I'm fine and now please just go away.
And the only thing that finally remains is the poison in my veins.

My mind's a slide show but the only content's pain. It shows me nothing more than darkness. But I'll clear up the hole mess once I poison  out my brain. 

Wanna get lost in meditation, they say it's all about the breathing. Always questioning the content but never questioning the meaning.

I'm drowning in my mind, can anyone please stop it. I wanna look forward not behind, but it won't even be worth it.


I'm reaching for the final peak, I haven't smiled in like 3 weeks. Leave my corpse on the rails just like all my other fails. I'm leaving like a coward all those wires are high-powered.

Laying on the ground with all these words unspoken but my bones aren't the only thing that's broken.

Broken bones and broken heart, I can't tell those two apart, draining blood, a piece of art, continueing the mascarade."
238,depression,Myself 13/m,"I think I have depression. I don't like myself, I don't like anyone-anything. I have 2 moods: I don't give a frick and I want to die and cry. I don't have the best familly, old father, mom a little bit of Karen, sister have lactose, gluten intolerance and almost got blind (She IS kinda ok right now). I'm thinking a lot about sucide but I don't want anyone of my familly sad so i didn't do it. I wold be happy if they just forgot about me. I don't get hungry I just don't want to live but I'm scared of pain and familly. Help

239,depression,Why is making friends and meeting new people so hard ?,I’ve always been a happy person on the outside someone who cares for other puts others before myself makes sure someone has a person there for them because I always wanted to help people and make it a career somewhere down the line in the future. Through high school and even now I was never good at making friends I’m like 4’10 4’11 the only friends I have that are close to me I moved away from and one is in the navy stationed in Virginia but when we talk they always have friends people to talk to there own groups and me I’m just left alone without anyone I’ve always been the type of person to stay strong but sometimes it finally hits that I feel like an any no one can see no one can hear and tbh I’ve never really had the issue of being alone but just I guess it finally just killed me and I’ve always been like this growing up and sometimes I wake up and just feel like when I die maybe things would be peaceful since I know what they say about that god loves everyone no matter who you are and that he loves everyone equally tbh at this point I always think what if I was really just a mistake like a experiment that wasn’t fully finished and somehow is still breathing everyday and living or however you can say test subject end up but it’s another crazy thing I always lay in bed to think about Is if it were only possible to switch lives with someone but then it hits me that I’ll put the person who comes in my shoes the same feelings as me and that would suck idk but it does feel cool getting to write my thoughts out on here
240,depression,Suicide is always on my mind,"Like no matter what I’m doing, where I am, who I’m with it’s the thought of finally killing my self is there. I wish I could do it so bad."
241,depression,Daily suicidal thoughts because of a single person..,"We were “together” for about 6 months. Went everywhere together, did everything together. And I mean EVERYTHING. We went on vacations, we work together in the same building, we had the same friends, I loved her. The first and only person I’ve ever loved in my whole life. I would kill for her. She gave me a breakup text and has ghosted me since about March and somehow I’m still as heartbroken as ever. I made the mistake of stalking her social media every once in a while which made it worse. I see her around the building we work at every couple days which just breaks my heart that I can’t talk to her and she doesn’t want to talk to me. And then today I saw her on tinder and it really fucked me up. Why do I still love someone that has wronged me so many times. I just can’t stop seeing her as the perfect human being for me. I’ve had daily suicidal thoughts every day and even got really close to going through with it a couple times. I have a loving family and a full time job, a good life. But I cut off all my friends and just sit inside all day depressed. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get away from her but I can’t get over her either. I’m sorry this was so long I appreciate u so very much for reading this.."
242,depression,The trauma door opened,"Supposedly, the brain blocks traumatic memories or bad experiences, right? And I had forgotten most of it, but today somehow I got triggered and just remembered everything; every bad thing, every memory with the corresponding emotion at the time, school years, awful therapists, awful childhood memories...

I try to convince myself that the things I went through weren't so bad compared to other people, but it still gave me a huge existential crisis and I know for a fact that tonight I won't sleep."
243,depression,How do you personally cope with severe emotional pain?,I’m already medicated on SSRI. My circumstances have escalated &amp; I can’t do anything about it. I’m just in inevitable emotional pain rn. I’m overwhelmed with this pain all the time.
244,depression,Loose skin after weight loss is depressing me,"So I’m a 21, 200 pound 5’11” male. So I’ve lost like 100 pounds in the past year. I did it because I wanted a confidence boost, a pretty girlfriend, and to look good physically. I hit my goal of 200 pounds a month ago and I feel good kind of but I’m still really not happy with my body. I have loose skin and I hate my saggy boobs most of all. My boobs was the biggest thing I wanted to get rid of and they’re still here. When I lay down on my back and my chest goes flat I dream of a day when I can finally be like that standing up and sitting down. I thought after all the hard work I would be happy with my body but I guess I never thought about the loose skin aftermath. I still hope that maybe within a year my skin will tighten and my muscle training will help it go away. I pray to god every night. And it doesn’t matter how many compliments I get from random people or how proud my family is of me, it doesn’t matter till I am happy with what I see in the mirror. I’m dying for the day to look good shirtless. I’m thinking about surgery but unfortunately I don’t believe I can afford it. I just don’t know what to do. I made this post to vent but I guess also because I hope that maybe someone can tell me there is still some hope that I will be at the body I want to be but it’s probably wishful thinking.

245,depression,I am not depressed. But why do I feel this way?,"First off I want to give a big hug to everyone on this sub. I know you’re all going through a lot more than me, but this is my problem that I want to talk about now

Lately I have been thinking about my past and all the fun I used to have as a child. Thinking about it makes me very sad. 

I also feel the constant need to be doing something. For example, I worked a long hard 8 hours at work today but I still feel the need to accomplish something every day but it’s just never enough. And even when I do what needed to be done, I want to do more so I don’t have to feel “depressed”

It’s gotten pretty bad and I’ve done so much lately that I just can’t find anything else for my daily accomplishments. It’s hard to sleep at night knowing all of this. Not to mention my lovely girlfriend that I wouldn’t trade the world for is the opposite- she likes a simple day and routine.

So I guess what I’m asking is, is this depression? If not then what is it? I pretty much hate relaxing unless I’m feeling the relaxing vibe, but other than that, I get sad and discouraged. Thank u all"
246,depression,My story part 2,"Start with part 1, Here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/iib0uo/yesterday\_i\_tried\_to\_write\_my\_story\_and\_the\_app/](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/iib0uo/yesterday_i_tried_to_write_my_story_and_the_app/)

&amp;#x200B;

A preface before the last 2 chapters of this story, It’s about to get even more dark.  I’m not proud of a lot of what I’m about to share with you.  At this time, the girl that stole my heart and I are on good terms although we are not at all a part of each others lives.  So I guess hold on to that if it seems like its only downhill from here.

I met Liz through my old Olive Garden co workers.  I had moved on to another restaurant, but was still living with friends I had met at the OG (as we call it).  Liz was a new server there and was out socializing with the crew.  I was instantly attracted to her, but I knew she was seeing someone, and I had just gotten out of a 2 year relationship in which I had been cheated on.  (Me and that girl are cool now too lol) So at first it was just a little harmless flirting when we happened to be at the same party.  Eventually she was single and I was drunk enough to tell her I liked her.  We hit it off unlike anything I have ever experienced.  We clicked mentally on almost every moral subject, and our ideals even matched.  We both wanted to learn more about nature and living sustainably, about the true history of our country and the people that run it, and basically both were at a point where we wanted to grow exponentially.  And we had amazing sex.  Our physical chemistry made our mental connection seem almost insignificant.  We had sex multiple times a day, almost every day for about a year and a half. We almost never argued during that time, and we did a lot of good in our community and friends lives.  We fed the homeless together, and even secured drop offs from a grocery store that normally threw away a bunch of good food, to be distributed to families in need.  We spent our summer on my family’s private property (it’s an 80 acre heavily wooded area with a few trails and camp spots on it) basically just gardening and playing in the woods.  Everything was perfect.

This next part needs a trigger warning.  I’m about to talk about sexual assault.  Maybe skip this paragraph if it will affect you too negatively.

Liz worked in a bar near my house.  We both worked at bar/restaurants that were open late, so it wasn’t unusual for us to not see eachother til sometimes 1 or 2 AM.  One evening, I get home from work and fall asleep waiting for Liz to arrive.  I wake up to a phone call, at 4 AM.  Liz is crying uncontrollably.  She’s talking a mile a minute and it’s hard to understand her.  She is clearly intoxicated though, as she’s slurring her words and is very confused.  She tells me she is in her car outside of her work and needs a ride.  I FLY out of my house, and drive to the bar where she works (about a 5 minute drive, it’s SUPER close).  When I get there….she isn’t there.  Her car isn’t there.  I panic.  I call her….she answers.  She is driving, laughing, and there are male voices in the background.  She is confused, and doesn’t even remember calling me only 10 minutes earlier sobbing uncontrollably.  She gets mad at me, yells at me, and hangs up the phone.  I panic harder.  She calls me back.  She is SCREAMING at someone to GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE CAR.  She gets mad at me for asking her what’s going on and says she’s on her way over.  She shows up 20 minutes later.  She walks into my room and I ask her what the fuck is going on.  She proceeds to throw her drivers license at me, and start yelling about me getting mad at her.  She is completely incoherent, jumping from subject to subject literally mid sentence.  She randomly asks, “What? You think I cheated on you?” and then passes out in my bed.  I couldn’t sleep.  I was physically sick from being so upset and concerned.  I had no idea what had happened, only that she had called me sobbing and scared and then not remembered it 10 minutes later.  She was with other people, laughing, and then minutes later screaming at them to get out of her car.  I eventually fall asleep for an hour or 2.

I worked the next morning.  I left her a note because I couldn’t get her to wake up.  About an hour into my shift I got the hardest phone call I’ve ever had in my life.  As soon as I answer liz is in tears.  She tells me one of her co workers had just called her to ask if she remembered them having sex the night prior.  My whole world fell apart.  It’s hard for me to even put this into words.  The love of my life had been raped while she was blacked out.  The guy who did it was sober enough to know that she wasn’t fully coherent.  He called to try and cover his ass but it backfired.  I took Liz’s side obviously.  None of my friends OR HER friends did.  They all were convinced that she had cheated on me and was lying.  I was so torn apart.  I didn’t know what to do.  I took Liz’s side immediately at the beginning, but over time more and more details kept coming out.  I couldn’t ignore that it wasn’t as malicious as Liz had originally described.  This is so hard to talk about because at the end of the day, She was 100% taken advantage of and was raped, in my opinion.  But through other people who were there that night, I learned that she had lied about a lot of what had happened.  They had been drinking and doing cocaine.  Liz swore she only had one drink, but her co workers told me she had been drinking all night. A few of her co workers even went to another bar with her after they got off work, where they did the coke.  Liz passed out in the bar, on a table.  She was literally unconscious on the table, and the guy who raped her and his friend carried her to her car, and drove her car to an apartment complex where a party was going on.  When the rapists friend went inside, he began to rape Liz.  During this time however, Liz was awake but backed out.  Someone tried to stop it from happening, but Liz slammed the door of the car, took her clothes off, and got on top of her rapist. This was told to me by people who were there, so I’ll never really know the truth.  It came out that Liz had given this guy a ride home late at night multiple times, and that he had tried to hit on her multiple times knowing she wasn’t single.  I didn’t know what to believe.  In my heart I again felt like a traitor for even considering that her rape was anything but a horrible sexual assault.  And at this current time, I still believe she was raped.  I eventually confronted her rapist.  I asked him for his side of the story...and it matched the same story everyone else except Liz was telling me.  That they had been flirting for a long time and that she had given him rides home and had even considered coming inside with him a few times, tho he said she hadn’t.  His version was basically that they all got fucked up and it just kinda happened.  I let him walk away.  Probably the biggest regret of my entire life.

To this day I don’t know the truth.  But I sided with Liz because ultimately, this guy had a chance to do the right thing when he had to carry her to her car.  He knew she had been unconscious already once that evening, and so his decisions from that point on were malicious and unforgivable.  That being said….there was enough doubt about the situation that I was never able to truly put it to bed.  This happened about a year and a half into our relationship.  We stayed together for about 3 more years though, somehow.  I supported her in every way I could, and tried to keep my insecurities to myself.  For a while it was fine.  But the trust was damaged irreparably.  In my heart I had put up a wall that never came back down.

We stayed together for a few years after that actually.  We did a lot of great things together.  I got a job where I was able to literally travel the country in a van selling weed pipes to headshops from New york to florida out to colorado and everywhere in between.  The best part was that I made enough money that I was basically able to budget liz into the travels as an assistant.  She helped set up the appointments and helped with handling the money.  We made a good team.  But from the time that she was assaulted all the way to the end of things, we treated each other terribly.  It started small, with disagreements and arguments that could have easily been avoided.  I was insecure about whether she had been raped or had cheated or if it was somewhere in the middle.  At first the arguing was normal.  It eventually escalated into screaming matches and just all around bad behavior on both our parts.  We held grudges against each other, and honestly most of it is my fault.  I never treated her quite the same after she was raped, and Ill have to take that with me to my grave.  Before that incident, I literally treated her like a goddess queen.  I went as far out of my way as I had to, to make sure she knew how special she was to me.  After her assault, my trust was damaged, and my patience reflected it.  Things I had been understanding of became a problem.  I started holding double standards.  I started saying things that I knew would hurt her, when normally I could bite my tongue for the sake of moving forward.  I was treating her like she had cheated on me even though she hadn’t.  She had something horrible happen to her and even worse, I doubted her.  I hate myself for that.  For ever implying that I didn’t believe everything she was telling me.  I honestly still don’t believe the story she told me completely, but I do know she was taken advantage of. It’s complicated.

Anyway, We ended up falling in love with a town we found during our work travels.  We ended up quitting our sales job and found work, and a place to live in Roanoke, VA.  Part of my heart is still there to this day.

So I should say real quickly, that Liz wasn’t well liked amongst my friends, and even some of her own friends back in our home town.  A lot of them never believed her assault story, and truthfully Liz was and EXTREMELY abrasive person to be around if you didn’t agree with her.  She had a horrible childhood and her coping mechanisms were terrible.  She was a VERY angry person.  We worked out well at first because of how laid back I am, but eventually over time there were no chill days left.  Only days of me helping Liz deal with her anger.  She would get mad in the morning about something little and carry that energy through the WHOLE day.  That drained me over time, and after the assault when I developed trust issues and insecurities, it made it EVEN HARDER to be patient with her.  I don’t blame her at all.  I was the one who was broken and not dealing with it.  I started pointing out her flaws everytime she would come at me with something.  Started invalidating her feelings because of how she was making me feel.  I thought of leaving often, but I didn’t want her to think it was because of the rape.  I didn’t want her to be uncared for.  I loved her, but it was hurting me to be with her.

To make our move to Virginia happen, I sold everything I owned.  My car, my van, my computer and all of my music equipment...everything.  I wanted us to have a chance to start over in a new place.  She didn’t have much to contribute, as I said she had a terrible childhood, and mine was at least easy from a materialistic aspect.  I thought nothing of it at the time.  After a few months in Virginia, our old problems followed us.  We started fighting and not being able to resolve issues.  I didn’t know it then but I had become severely depressed and was dragging her down with me.  I completely stopped trying to be romantic and thoughtful, and would only do so after I said or did something that hurt her feelings.  I was so afraid that she needed me to survive, that I was blind to that fact that she never did at all.  I thought I was protecting her and helping her because of her anger by staying with her.  She was trying so hard to be a better person and to fix her flaws, and I never gave her enough credit.  I focused on what bothered me.  I would still treat her well until she upset me, then I would go cold as winter.  I was such an idiot.  I drove her farther and farther away….until the night that finally broke me for good.

This is gonna get darker still.  This is the last part.  This is what finally broke me and led me to where I sit at this very moment.  If you’re still here...hang on tight and grab some tissues.

(gonna be continued in a second part)

I finally realized, far too late, the damage I had been doing.  I decided to change, and to try and save the relationship.  (something she had been doing for a looooong time, which I hadn’t even acknowledged) At this time we were really low on money, so we were sharing my cell phone and driving just her car (I sold mine in the move).  I would drop her off with my phone at work, and she would message me on FB so I could get it on the tablet to know when she was off and needed a ride, and we would switch when I had to work.  Well, one day she had my phone at work and I had the tablet.  She forgot to log out of her name on the tablet.  Messages started popping up.  It was her and one of her co workers talking about what had happened the night before.  About how he had her pressed up against the bar, and how she enjoyed it which is why she hadn’t stopped him.  I felt like Mike Tyson in his prime had just gut punched me.  She was cheating on me for real this time.  I waited until she came back home (she had taken the car since I had the day off) and confronted her.  She panicked and claimed it was a misunderstanding and that she had been drunk.  She said she messaged him to basically smooth shit out and let him know it was inappropriate.  I…..gave her the benefit of the doubt…..like an idiot.  She swapped the phone for the tablet and made sure to log out of FB on the phone, and went back to work as she was on a double shift.  When she arrived home later, she set her bag down with the tablet in it and went to the bathroom.  I couldn’t help myself.  I grabbed the tablet and went through her messages with her coworker (Who has my same first name btw, really fucked me up). I couldn’t believe what I found.  Not only had she lied about setting boundaries, she told him that I found out, confronted her, and then proceeded to talk shit about me to this guy! She even asked him to buy her a coffee for when she got back for her next shift!! I was heartbroken...but still thought quickly enough to put the tablet back.  When she came back into the room, I asked her casually if she had talked with the guy and set those boundaries.  She said yes.  I asked to see the messages.  Her expression became panicked.  She said sure, one sec I just have to respond to this message real quick. And proceed to tap the screen like CRAZY.  I asked what she was doing and she made up some BS about trying to get her shift covered the next day.  I snatched the phone from her to see she was deleting all the messages I had just read.  Again, I couldn’t believe it.  She was lying right to my face. And lying like it was NOTHING. We had a screaming match that ended with us going to bed mad.

The next day, she had to work another double.  I decided to spend the day cleaning and doing yard work to surprise her when she got home, because I was delusional and still thought i could fix the situation.  That night was one of the worst of my life.  I’ve never felt such deep emotional pain.  It scarred me to my core.

It was getting late, and Liz wasn’t home yet, nor had she reached out to let me know when she would be back.  She wasn’t responding to my texts, so I assumed the bar was busy.  I tried calling as soon as the bar closed and one of her co workers went and got her for me.  She was pissed.  She was mad that I called her work place and that I hadn’t just waited for her to respond to me.  I felt bad, so I apologized, but she hung up on me anyway.  Then an hour went by.  Then 2.  No texts, no calls.  I called the bar but there was no answer.  I started texting her co workers, saying that I understood if she didn’t want to talk to me but that I just needed to know if she was safe.  None of her friends knew where she was….except one who had seen her leave with the co worker she had been messaging.  Eventually it got late enough that I was worried about her having been arrested or in an accident, so I called the police and hospitals but couldn’t find any information.  Eventually, one of her coworkers named Maggie got back with me and told me that she had been with a few co workers and that she was probably just with them still.  She really consoled me and helped put me at ease.  I was having a full on panic attack.  I was out of my mind.  I couldn’t believe after everything we had been through that she was doing this to me.  Fast forward to about 4AM.  I get a message from Liz on FB saying she is sorry she fell asleep and is on the way home.

I had been going crazy for hours.  Literally insane.  I was watching out the windows for hours hoping to see headlights coming.  I made call after call to try and find her, I was hyperventilating, and felt nauseous the whole time.  And then the flashbacks hit me.  Of her walking into my room at 4AM, throwing her license at me. Yelling about being accused of cheating.  Every single old wound from her assault opened back up for me.  The trust issues, the desperation of trying to find out what was going on, the absolute lack of control I felt over the situation...it was excruciatingly painful for me to go through again.  And this time she was doing it on purpose.  When she finally walked through the door, I immediately asked her where she had been.  She told me she had been with Maggie.  The girl who had been on the phone with me for over an hour trying to help me find her.  So I knew instantly she was lying to me.  That was the moment.  That was the exact moment that my entire world fell apart.  I never would have believed she would have done that to me after her assault unless I had caught her myself.  I told her that maggie had been trying to help me find her all night and she started crying.  She confessed she had been at the guys house she had been messaging but swore that nothing happened.  I didn’t believe a word of it and I still don’t to this day, though she sticks to her story of just “falling asleep on his couch.”

The next day I decided I needed to leave, hoping that she would try and fix things.  I was wrong again.  After buying my plane ticket, we were civil to each other but it was clear she was relieved that I was leaving.   So 3 days after catching her cheating, I kissed her one last time through a wall of tears and got on my plane back to my home town.  I’ll never forget turning around, hoping to see her running back to me, only to just catch a glimpse of her as she walked out of the airport. We had gotten a puppy a few months prior, and she wouldn’t let me take him home with me, so I literally came back home with nothing back a backpack full of clothes.

Things don’t really go up from here, and the story is almost finished.  I can summarize a lot of the last few years since I left Viriginia.  Upon arriving back home, my friends let me stay on their couch until I figured out what to do.  There was a few weeks of back and forth between Liz and I about our relationship, but the final straw came when she went to a music festival with the guy she cheated on me with.  I couldn’t believe how easy it was for her to just move on.  It made me wonder if she ever really loved me at all, or if I had been just the next survival tactic for her.  I know she loved me, but during this time period I questioned it all.  I reopened my own wounds about her assault almost daily.  Wondering if she had lied about that too.  There were so many similarities between the night of her assault and the night I caught her cheating that I let my own mind run with the possibilities.  I started drinking every day, usually first thing in the morning.  I have smoked weed since I was 19, but my habit more than doubled overnight and has become worse since.  I ruined almost every single one of my friendships since coming back.  I just never recovered from the whole ordeal.  I couldn’t keep my job because I would spend half my shift fighting with liz via text or phone call.  I had to move back in with my parents because I felt guilty for taking advantage of my friends willingness to help me out. I worked with my dad for a while doing flooring, but quit after I just couldn’t force myself to get out of bed anymore.  I spent about a year just existing as a drunk, high, emotionally wrecked piece of shit.  I dove back into video games, playing 12 to 16 hours a day, which I still currently do.  I became a recluse.  I couldn’t be around my friends without feeling like I was supposed to be the person I used to be. I developed extreme anxiety about being in public in general, and basically fell apart to the point that my parents have had to take care of me like a child ever since.  I have had a few jobs in the interim, but nothing that lasts long due to how broken my mind is.

These days, I go through extreme ups and downs.  Manic days where I will work out and run a few miles, then depressed weeks where I’ll eat nothing but coffee and sugar while wishing I didn’t exist.  My ability to maintain relationships has all but completely fallen apart.  The people still in my life know they have to carry most of the weight of the relationship or there wouldn’t be one at all.  I eventually got a dog who I love with my whole heart, but the guilt of not being able to provide for her without my parents help is eating me alive.  And a lot of days I can’t bring myself to give her the attention she deserves.  Eventually, Liz reached out to me and asked me to take the dog we had gotten together (which I had begged her for when i original moved back home) so I drove to virginia and got him back. His name is Otto, and my girl dog is named Faith.  Both are pitbulls, and are just the absolute greatest thing in my life.

My family is not great either.  I live with my mom, dad, and grandpa in my moms house.  I say my mom and not my parents, because as an adult I have come to realize how horribly irresponsible my father is.  My mom has always taken care of everything important.  My dad has pretty much behaved as if going to work and earning his check was all he had to do.  My mom did the same, made more money, AND literally took care of ALL the bill paying, organizing school stuff for my siser and I (until college…..) and basically just anything and everything requiring responsibility, my mom did it.  And my dad had the NERVE to complain to his co workers WHILE I WAS WORKING WITH HIM about my mom being a bitch sometimes.  She takes his shit and his laziness for months at a time without giving him shit and when she finally does, shes the bad guy.  I hate it.  My dad never developed a plan.  He never did anything other than the bare minimum of going to work and smoothing shit over with my mom.  We would have had nothing if my mom hadn’t held us all together.  My dad is awful with money.  He never has been good with it.  He lies to my mom still to this day about it and what he spends it on, and he laughs about it at times with is friends.  Like hes pulling one over on her.  I fucking hate it.  It’s so hard because I love the man and have so many great memories with him, but I can’t even look him in the eyes anymore for more than a second.  My mom only asks that he keeps the house clean and cooks dinner most nights.  She works a lot and makes great money so hes supposed to be her at home partner but again, he does the bare minimum.  Drinks all day, then tries to power clean an hour before she gets home to make it seem like he’s been busy all day.  He just plain drags his feet on any home restoration project.  My moms bathroom has been unusable for years because it takes months of her asking him to do one little thing in there before he’ll finally get annoyed with her bitching and do it.  He spends her money on beer while getting groceries to hide it, and then lies about how much he drinks.  He tries to hide all the beer boxes in the garage too, then throw them away when she isnt around but he’s lazy so theres probably 30 of them out there right now.  (Our garage is unusable, its full of trash and junk and all the remnants of my moms hoarding)

And every single little thing I feel about my father, I feel 100x harder about myself.  I’m doing nothing to help.  I’m useless.  I clean up after myself but thats it.  I don’t bring in money, I don’t really clean or help out around the house much other than the stuff I also use.  I smoke as much weed as I can get my hands on and I drown myself in video games.  I’ve given up on everything I’ve ever been passionate about in one way or another.  I am draining my families resources and I have no real ambition or motivation to change left.  I can’t get a job because I can’t stand being around people for more than a few minutes, and I am unreliable on days I am depressed.  I literally can’t force myself to do anything at all some days.  Meanwhile the world is getting crazier and crazier around me with politics and social media fueling the fires of civil unrest.  There is so much injustice and pain in the world and I feel all of it.  On top of feeling my own traumas.  Now I feel too weak to even be of use at all, and I can’t seem to find an outcome where I get through this.  I’m going to be a drain for as long as I’m alive on the resources of those around me.  I’ve given up all hope for a better future, and everything just feels pointless because of the amount of work I would have to do just to get back to a place where maybe someday I can get ahead.  I am so burnt out from my life.  I’ve given everything I had and come away with nothing but pain too many times now.  There isn’t any single area of my life that isn’t touched by trauma or depression.  Theres no safe place for me anymore.  Nowhere I can go and nothing I can do that stops the pain for more than a little bit.  And I just can’t keep doing this.  It’s a pointless existence.  I’ll never be a person who can just get up and go to work and pay my bills and check all the boxes society expects me to check, and I also am not driven enough to find my own way anymore….so theres really only one end in sight and I’m basically trying to build myself up to just ending it all.  I have a few things I still need to do first.  I need to cut and donate my hair because it’s honestly beautiful.  Its almost down to my butt and I get compliments all the time when I am around people lol I’m sure it will make someone happy.  And I know if I do end my life it will be with a gunshot to the head, so my hair would be ruined.  Might as well donate it first to be useful in some way.  Beyond that, I need to make sure that my dogs will be taken care of.  I’m going to ask my sister to take them, and as selfish as it is I’m going to ask my parents to help her financially take care of them.  I’ve listed all my material possessions and who they go to.  At this point its just getting my hair taken care of, smoking the rest of my weed, and trying to find the courage to finally put all of this to bed.

This has been my story.  Thank you if you made it this far.  I don’t blame you if you didn’t.  There is even more than I wrote here, but I think this covers the majority of the turning points in my life that are worth mentioning."
247,depression,Any advice from people who have experience with psychiatrists?,"I've been to different psychologists and therapists since I was 14 after my mother passed away (I'm 26 now) and none of them really helped me. Their methods were mainly positive thoughts...At some point I decided that I can do it myself and quit going...But in reality I think my mental health got worse and worse with the years. I guess I can't help myself. My low self-esteem and self-hatred grew bigger and bigger to the point that every day I just wish I don't exist at all. My depression is destroying me....It's like acid in my soul.  
So now I hope that maybe a psychiatrists will help me with my struggles, if it's not too late....but I'm so anxious to go. It's like my last hope and I'm scared that if it doesn't work this time as well, I must accept the fact that I will ""live"" and die a miserable human. I already booked and canceled  once because I got scared a few hours before the appointment....But I'm planning to pluck up my courage and go soon...And if you have any advice for me, I would be so grateful. What to expect? How to prepare? And if any of you is/was on medication....did it help you for real or it's overrated?"

Or am I just completely wrong? I'm clueless about this kind of stuff.
251,depression,How can I cope years later?,"I have been having reoccurring nightmares of the night my best guy friend sexually assaulted me when I was inebriated the first time ever. For some reason last nights nightmare was more real than the others and has made my depression worse than it typically is on any given day and made me on edge and scared all day. It’s like I’m reliving it all over again. I know I need talk therapy since the dreams keep coming back, but I’m broke and can’t afford it. 

I was just wondering if anyone has any kind of coping skills or ideas to help me deal with it, when the dream happens again so it doesn’t put a damper on my whole day and I live in fear. Granted my fiancé is understanding when I tell him about the dreams but it still just sucks. Feels like I am alone because he doesn’t know what it’s like to have that happen and relive it on a constant basis. 

Thank you in advance 🙃"
252,depression,My depression/anxiety diagnosis is getting in the way of treating another illness,"**If you look on my account, you can see my posts that provide greater detail about my physical illness.**

I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety when I was 12. I was given medication and I was much happier after that. But now that I have an undiagnosed physical condition and have to go through so much testing, my depression has also come back at its worst. My doctors are now thinking I’m a faker because I’m too young (15) to be experiencing these physical symptoms (fatigue/joint pain). They blame it on my anxiety. Now I’m starting to think this physical pain is all in my head ((I definitely know it’s not, but my doctors are making me feel that way)). At this point, after so many months, I’m too tired, physically and mentally, to fight for more tests to find a diagnosis. I just don’t want to be sick anymore. The physical pain I’m experiencing has taken such a mental toll. I just feel like giving up."

I have no money to even try to get some kind of treatment so that's out the window. Just someone to check up on me. Someone I can cry to. Someone I can hang up on and they'll call me back cause they know it's just cause I'm upset. Just so I don't feel so alone fighting all of this bullshit."
258,depression,Good commentary/video essay youtubers,"Hey y’all. I usually listen (not watch because I like to do other things at the same time) to YouTube to drown out the sound of the good old demons and my crippling anxiety (it works really well for me, I just shift my focus to the audio and keep myself distracted that way). Problem is I’m running out of them. At least the videos that are long enough and doesn’t depend too much on visual information. 

Any of you have any recommendations of people to watch/listen to? Right now I really like people like Danny Gonzales or Drew Gooden, or on the more video essay side TRO and Quintin Reviews.  I also kinda like when they’re a bit longer so I don’t have to get my phone and turn on new videos all the time. 

And just a pro tip as a thanks for reading this far. If you like to listen to stuff to fall asleep and you have an iphone, you can set a timer and change the ringtone to “pause” or “stop” and it will just stop whatever the phone is playing at the time it runs out. No ringing, just pausing."
259,depression,no one cares about me,my mom literally cares about my brother so much more than me because he is smarter than me like she doesn’t even care about me at all she says that I’m a bad kid for talking back to her when I am trying to stand up for myself and makes fun of me whenever I leave my room that’s why I’m always in my room because I’m afraid to get humiliated infront of my own family I just want to leave my family because everyone in my family doesn’t care about me one bit I hate my brothers because they’re so clueless and they make fun of me as much as my mom does. It’s so annoying and I don’t even feel comfortable talking to any of them about personal problems she lets my brother sleepover at his friends house and lets him do more things than I am able to. I cry most nights because I am so tired of this I hate my life and I hate the people I’m surrounded by because no one seems to notice I have feelings as well.
260,depression,it hurts to dream,"today, after months, i dreamt with my ex bf... this was a recuring thing that went on from our breakup in february til june, every single day... i just feel so stupid. it went from the breakup to one of our related friends telling me he doesnt hate me, and this is where my problem lies. i dreamt he was interacting with me online, that we chat, popped up in my notifications, like he never left. its one of those dreams i wake up feeling like crying, bc it would be less hurtful if he just hated me and then left, but these dumb situations keep materializing in my head while i sleep and it consumes me the entire day, then the day after... just needed to vent. this will keep happening for the next days, i just need to get used to it again :/"
261,depression,People asked my SO if I was really worth the effort.,"I don't know why he suddenly decided to tell me, but apparently his friends and my dad all asked him, while I was catatonic, if I was really worth the effort.

262,depression,"I am slowly, successfully, though unintentionally, pushing those closest to me away. And I think it's for the best.","Just kinda a realization I had after coming out of what felt like a month long manic episode. I just...woke up with clairty.

I'm a steamroller. I'm a success story to some. A tragedy to others. To most I'm that annoying friend or coworker, either annoying in general, or annoyingly depressing. I feel like I'm 3 different people sometimes. Lately I've been the confident, relaxed, accomplished me. Today I've been slowly dissolving into another me which doubts everything. Why am I the way I am? Am I really as cute as I thought I was in the picture? That outfit? Was I  as funny as I thought with that joke at work, did they laugh but talk shit after? Was the way I approached and directed a new hire for hiding in the back trying to chat up a girl the right way to go about it? Am I good at what I do? Will I ever be good at anything? 

Jack of all trades but master of none.

Then there's the PTSD, anxiety, and depression crippled me. The me that made me make this reddit account to reach out to the world, from my jail cell of an abusive household. Anonymity! Just delete the app when he's home! I've made great friendships from this app. Those friends pushed me to get out and I did.

Now what?

I make memories out of feelings. I get jealous of people I love. When the sun shines I say I like it better cloudy, but when its cloudy I complain. 

My memory eludes me. Did that happen? Such a weight I feel when I remember 3 of my phones were destroyed by him. The reason most of my brain does not find what I am searching for. And now, the dread of waking up to search for receipts of bad behavior after a manic episode. Sometimes pain, sometimes relief. At least I am on my own now and my phone is mine.

If karma is a bitch then she knows nothing of me.

I go weeks on this high of confidence. Then weeks of self doubt and getting out of bed to even pee is a struggle. Set aside my chronic pain disorders, set those aside like I do most memories when they pop up. Then out of a cocoon of depression emerges a manic butterfly, one who only cares of it's own majesty. *I was a lowly Caterpillar, but I'm gorgeous now.* Fuck you and what you think, I'm a butterfly, give me that sweet sweet nectar that is attention, validation, affection. Tell me I'm pretty. Love me love me love me I DON'T CARE HOW YOU FEEL.

And then clairty again. A cycle. A circle. Mac Miller gives me light and dare I quote him for my own self expression. 

""I just end up right at the start of the line

Drawing circles"""
263,depression,Want to die but I’m too afraid,"I feel hopeless and empty. I feel lonely and sad. I am seeing a therapist and on anxiety and depression medication. Some days are good but life always reminds me that it never gets better. I just live in a hopeful fantasy for a few weeks and then boom I’m back here again. I hate to admit I want to end it all but am too scared bc i don’t know if others will think I’m dramatic or attention seeking. I try to stay positive and see the good and be thankful but i can’t. I just can’t.

I feel jealous sometimes when I see people talking and laughing with each other, but after a long journey of struggles with negative thoughts and depression I think I just reached a time to accept everything about my lonely life and focus on other things that may make me happy .. this is not meant to be for me."

but he fucking dropped out of teaching school

im almost 18 now and we've been in this hell hole this whole time

the house is so shit, so fucking small, i cant even invite any of my friends over because im fucking embarrassed

my room is so fucking dusty, i wake up every morning and i cant fucking breathe from the dust up my fucking nose

my parents said that they were gonna buy a new house this year and they hyped me up for it and turns out once fucking again, we can't afford it

they just get my hopes up and crush them for everything and honestly i'm pissed at them for being so irresponsible, if they worked a bit harder, we'd be able to actually afford things

i have friends whos parents work 2 jobs but my parents are just fucking lazy and they dont give a shit about my happiness or my future

i was really trying to get into university interstate so i could move out and live in a nice dorm room but i got really sick this year and im not going to be able to, im just fucking pissed because i was looking forward to moving out this way for YEARS and im not going to be able to

As someone who also goes through social anxiety, talking to people is also really hard, not impossible, but hard. 

I can actually say because of my ability to just suck at talking, it lead me to becoming depressed which now I’m in a cycle of pushing away the only friends I had because of fear of me being annoying. I’d remember every single convo and constantly call myself annoying, pushing away anyone I have a conversation with because I just know they’ll think I’m annoying if I keep talking to them.

But that’s the thing. I want someone to talk to. I want someone to care and to be there for me. But I just keep pushing those things away. I’m not someone who shows much emotion, for example crying. I never do that when I’m with people. But catch me in my bed at 1 AM simply crying and hugging my huge ass stuffed animal wishing that it was someone because I’m lonely and depressed. I wish I could cry into someone’s shoulders. It feels like that’s what’s missing in my life, just expressing all my sadness into someone’s shoulder, but I would never do that because the sadness and more emotions of hating myself only comes to my surface when I’m alone and replaying every interaction I had. That’s why I push people away, because I don’t want interactions to replay... but then it’s a cycle of wanting all of this to happen, someone to talk to, someone to be there, and then the replaying happens again. It really sucks because I relapse because I had this interaction where my coworker actually noticed my wrist and asked about it. Like always, at the moment, I had the convo but once I got home, give it like an hour and I start replaying everything and then I realized how fkn annoying and how I just sucked at talking about it that I found myself relapsing in order to distract myself from replaying convos in my brain and just focus on the relief of pain. 

I did have friends who cared. I thought I was a burden and now I barely talk to them because well, my social anxiety got even worse to the point I can’t speak to the closest people to me besides my family. I don’t reach out because why should my annoying piece of crap self do that? I’m just curious if anyone else yearns for certain things, only to realize you’re also pushing away those things at the same time."
273,depression,Think I'm my own enemy.,My parents found out I hurt myself mabey a year ago and didnt take it well and instantly jumped to the conclusion that I needed serious mental help. I am disgusted that its getting really bad again but I'm to worried to tell them as I dont want to throw this at them and them be worried again. I cant keep trying to drink my way out of this or its gonna get worse. Anyone have any advice? Sorry for making you listen to my problems.
274,depression,Right now in this very moment I do not want to kill myself but I desperately want death,"I am not sitting here crying and nothing major has happened. I'm sitting on a chair looking at this phone with the same blank facial expression as ever as I type this. I'm not sad, I don't feel like crying and I don't feel like harming myself. Yet in this very moment I want nothing more than a bullet to go through my fucking head.  
  
I've tried medicine, exercise, meditation and a bunch of other shit everyone recommends. These things do work for some people and they do for me sometimes. But in the end I'm always back here wanting to not exist anymore. I am tired. I am drained. I wish nothing more than to not be completely empty all the time. I wish there was some sort of magic cure that just worked because I'm so lost. I feel trapped by living. Every moment is suffocating. I just don't want to exist anymore.  
  
I can't kill myself because it'd completely destroy my family. My mother's barely coping with losing her parents back to back so quickly within the last few years. She seems to always be on the edge and scared that something will happen to us. Ending my life would push her over the edge without a doubt. I feel selfish and horrible for wishing death upon myself. Yet I can't stop imagining a bullet flying through one side of my skull and out the other at this very moment as I type this. It seems like such a relief, a burden off my shoulders, a release from the emptiness I feel trapped in. It seems so soothing and peaceful.  
  
If you're worried and about to leave a message telling me not to kill myself then don't worry. I have no access to guns or any other way of killing myself. I'm living at home right now and everyone else is here so there's no chance I'd actually try something. I don't even feel like trying to actively kill myself, just to not exist anymore. Although if there was a pill in front of me that would kill me in an instant I can't say I wouldn't take it. 

So for now I will stay trapped for a little longer. Looking forward to a possible chance in the future where killing myself would be a viable option and until then just imagining a bullet going through my brain for some momentary peace. Thank you for reading. I hope you all find what you're looking for."

She pushes boundaries all the time like tells me my mom is bad for me [I have no problem with my mother] and I need to live on my own which I can't even imagine since rent here is so high and I have awful social anxiety and she tells me my mom is causing my depression partially and tells me ""Oh you need to meditate, work out X amount of times after doing X"" which doesn't help me at all like how am I supposed to do something when I'm full of so much malaise and I feel like crying or just in a awful mood. 

She just beats me down a lot and says I should be doing more and my life is going past and how her kids are disciplined better, how my achievements are so small, it just feels like I'm getting beat down each time I see her and it's hard..."
279,depression,I made a rap about s*icide. TW,"We’re just suicidal kids talking to suicidal kills saying 


Don’t commit your own murder


Don’t take your life 


But we’re really bad at taking our own advice 




We got our mothers sayin 


we ain’t suicidal kids 


They show us no love but expect us to 
reciprocate it 



Taking your life is not a trend 


If you think it is then your opinion should end 


Taking your life is not a game 


Even if it was


It should not be played 



The happiest ones are always dancing in the rain 


But really they cry theirselves to sleep 
and are hiding all their pain 



They say if you suicidal 


Then you should get some help


But what it is you don’t understand is I’m bad at getting help 



Sleeping is torture every night I have nightmares


instead of dreams 


Take the stress off my back 


Let me rest at peace 


“The easiest way out is not being in life”


No your mind is a weapon


It’s using you like a toy 


Don’t let it take a hold of you 


Don’t let it let you destroy 



I promise it’ll get better


There’s people along the way


They’ll help you and change you and inspire you and show you


Life 


Is beautiful  


And life


Is not all pain"
280,depression,"Tried switching meds to lose weight, backfired","I'm just angry about this. I'm way too dependent on Lexapro to ever come off of it again. I tried switching to Wellbutrin and it was awful: headaches, blurred vision, stomach pain and diarrhea, not to mention that it did nothing for my depression. I tried that medicine for two weeks and I couldn't take it anymore. As soon as I went back to the Lexapro, everything was fine again, except I'm still overweight.

I shouldn't be this heavy. I should only be 10-15 pounds overweight, not 30. I eat and drink fine. My job gives me exercise. The problem is the Lexapro, and possibly my alkaline-only diet, since I have interstitial cystitis. Before I went on Lex four years ago, I was looking like Britney Spears. I was the thinnest I'd ever been. I was on Sertraline before and even that didn't make me this fat.

I hate doctors. I hate the medical industry. Big Pharma is a real thing. There should be pills for this that actually work. There should be an antidepressant that does only that, and not make you fat, crave carbs, etc. There should be weight loss pills that work for people who don't want to diet or exercise (I've tried everything that I possibly could, even liver flushing). There should be acne medication that you don't need to sign a fucking waiver for because the med causes birth defects, especially if you're asexual and don't need to worry about it! I could go on and on, but I'll stop now. Just... finds cures for shit."

282,depression,Anyone here experience extreme depression lows beore/during your period? Any tips?,"This year I've developed extreme lows in depression before and during my periods. I become extremely fixated on thinking negative thoughts about myself, don't take care of myself (as I can hardly get out of bed), and cry multiple times per day.

Last month was especially rough, and I couldn't stop thinking about self-harm. I really don't want a repeat of that, but I'm feeling the negative thoughts start to kick in again. Those of you who experience this, do you have any tips?

P.S.: I know I need therapy, but I can't afford it at all right now. I spent my savings on BetterHelp last month, for the counselor to just tell me ""you need to see a psychologist and get some medication."" Gee, thanks."
284,depression,I don't know what's wrong with me,"I'm a nice person but some how because my social anxiety or something I've never had a friend since I was little. I have an awesome family but I don't feel any connection with them although I do love them very much. I have a lot of depression and I'm too afraid to tell that to anyone I know so I always choose to keep them alone. I can't express my feeling, I don't have any goals, dreams at all. I always end up alone in my class, school bus, all my classmates don't like me because they think I don't like them although it's not true :C. I don't even like how I look and act. I always feel useless :C I'm too tired to tell people that I'm ok though I'm not. Sorry if I'm over reacted, I just really need to share this and sharing it online is the only way I can do."

286,depression,19M looking for friends to vent out all our fucking problems," 

Helloooo, I´m Gilber and I´m Mexican.

My clinic analysis says that I´m depressive, I suffer of Insomnia and anxiety, These mental health issues made me take a wrong way: drugs.

Right now I´m struggling with some hard drugs addictions.

I´m a good listener. Let´s have a deep conversation and vent each other and move forward together.

HMU uwu, have a nice day..&lt;3"
287,depression,Am I making the right choices?,"Hi everyone. I’m about a year out of college and I’ve been living at home while working. I’ve been able to save up a decent bit on foregone rent in exchange for helping my parents around the house (and in their words, giving them a third person to talk to). 

Here’s the problem though, I’ve gone through bouts of depression that started early on in college. I feel like life is passing me by as many of my friends are having fun living in the city about a half hour away. I can see them when I want on the weekends, but it’s not the same. I feel like my dating life is stunted because I’m living at home (I’ve gone on a number of dates with different folks and it’s never worked for very long, which wasn’t the case in college). Even though I’m working and generally like my job, I feel like I lack direction in life as well. 

Apologies for the word salad. Obviously this next question is complicated by the pandemic, but do you all think I need to bite the bullet on rent and go live off on my own? My parents tell me they want me to stay, but I feel my life just isn’t worth living anymore and I need something new."
288,depression,Good days and bad,Today is turning into a bad day. Its turning into a day of bad thoughts. I just don't want to be anymore but I know I will just keep dragging myself on pointlessly. Every day I hope to be lucky enough to pass but it never happens. I have no drive or goals anymore as the things I have wanted either fail or fall apart. Guess I'll finish today and see if tomorrow is any better.
289,depression,My composure is finally breaking.,"I've been feeling this way for half my life and I've almost broken and told someone about it a few times. But right now I just really want to tell someone and get help. I really just wish I could skip straight to getting help and skip all the ""coming out"" and the anxiety is killing me. Telling my parents might get me results faster but I don't want to tell them because then I'd have to explain they are 50% of the problem (other 50% from school and ""friends""). I want to tell one of my cousins (they are sisters) but If i do I don't know what to do to make it not go anywhere. If I could go to a doctor independently and without my parents wanting to be part of it I would've done it already. I don't think anyone genuinely knows how depressed and anxious I have been my whole life. This is why I need advice. 

I need to know if I should tell someone because if I tell them and it goes nowhere it'll just be another source of anxiety and hopelessness. And to top it off they will feel bad when i tell them especially if i tell them ""the person they knew was thinking of suicide since he was 8 and they didn't notice"".

I just wish I could instantly get a doctor or therapist that could diagnose me and fix me, without ""coming out"" because the anxiety of doing that would cut all my functionality in my brain and would cause immense ""pain"" that would turn me into an anxious potato. I wish I could tell them and get help but they would make me explain every detail to see if I wasn't lying and I can't handle it."
290,depression,My Dogs Keep Me Alive,"I’m so empty. So lonely. So full of regret. I so badly want to just go away, but I can’t. My dogs are 10 and 8, and I would never want to abandon these guys. But I’ll say this- the day they’re both gone, I’m gone. I can’t imagine my life without them."
291,depression,I'm just too sad for everyone,"I have always been sad. Since I witnessed the death of my father and my mother turning into an alcoholic that abused me, I have felt like the world is a cruel place with no justice.

I have been left, thrown out and hated because I was just ""too sad"". My foster mother kicked me out because she couldn't handle me being ""sad"". I have been dumped because I have been ""too sad"". I don't know how I can *stop* being *sad*.

I met a lovely guy. I adore him. I have the biggest crush and I want to be with him. But he can't handle me being ""too sad"" and now I have to move out of our home. He broke up with me. I have to leave and this just isn't something I can handle. I have been through this so many times. I can't stop feeling that I'm supposed to be alone.

Why can't I just stop being sad? Nobody wants me like this. Not even myself.

My sadness fucked my life up again. I am unemployed due to the Covid crisis. I don't have any money for a new apartment. I don't have family. I will be starving for the next months, and I don't want to do that again. I have been starving for so long. I don't want to be alone. My PTSD just keeps acting up.

Why the fuck do I have to be so fucking sad?"

I want to be left alone a lot but then someone asks if I want to hang out and I say ""not today"". Then they ask again the next day and it keeps going. It pisses me off quite a bit because I know that if I say that ""I don't want to hang out for about a month"" Or something like that, he will talk shit and be pissy about it. I just wish people would understand that I don't want anyone around me, right now. If I tell that to my mom, she will feel sad and that makes me sad because she is a sweet lady, I just want to find myself so I can be prepared for life."
294,depression,What’s the point?,"Why should I even try to do well in fucking anything? Why should I even do well in school if nasty fucked-up humans ruined the climate and I probably won’t even live to make something out of myself, even if I wanted to?"

296,depression,My boyfriend (24M) of three years broke up with me (21F) because of my depression. How can I stop blaming myself?,"My grandmother passed away approximately one year ago. My mother’s family also disowned me around the same time because I decided to move out of our home (in my culture it is expected to stay until you are married). As a result, I gradually fell deeper and deeper into a depression. On top of this, moving out wasn’t all it was cracked up to be; my roommates were terrible and given my friends moved away for university, I felt more alone than ever. I didn’t recognize the symptoms as severe depression until a few months ago. As I said, it was gradual... I began binging and purging and developed bulimia. I became angry at everything, including my boyfriend. I was unforgiving about his past mistakes. Every small fight was sort of blown up, mostly by me. I started drinking heavily. I realized I needed help when I became suicidal. When I told him this, he automatically assumed I was lying(?) and distanced himself from me. I know this was wrong of him to do but it made me feel as if it was my fault. We were completely fine and as happy as can be before my mental illness became worse... When I realized how bad it was I said I would get help and he said he felt it was “wrong” for him to “wait around until I got better”. I blame myself completely. I feel like it’s all my fault and he refused to talk to me. I have OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. I feel like it’s all my fault for pushing him away. 

I don’t blame him for breaking up with me. I think maybe the best solution for us would be to have taken a “break” or stay together while I get better and now he won’t even open my messages. He did it in the worst way possible - through ghosting/text message. I am not even mad. I just feel like it’s my fault for not getting help sooner and I wish I did, I feel like it could’ve saved my relationship. I know we are young but we talked about marriage and I was so close with his parents that I messaged his mom every few days. Now they hate me. Our mutual friend has abruptly stopped talking to me and his friends also hate me.

TL;DR: How can I stop blaming myself for the break up? I blame myself for not getting help and not recognizing my severe depression."
298,depression,Why can't everyone be attractive and sociable people?,"Why can't I (and everyone really) be attractive, and personable social human beings?  I can't hold a conversation, I'm average looking at best and pretty overweight now thanks to covid.  

But every time I hop on reddit I see posts of attractive people posing or some shit and the posts get thousands of upvotes.  These people that are complete strangers on reddit get recognition and positive praise simply for their looks.  I can only imagine how much easier their life is than mine.  To be treated better and be thought of as being a good person only because they're attractive.  

People who are personable and social and not afraid of confrontation are extremely lucky as well.  And some people may say it's something you have to work towards, but I know several people in my life that just have always been that way from when they were young.  

A guy I know got a sales job selling insurance.  Cold calling, which to someone like me who keeps to myself, sounds like absolute hell.  But he thrived in that environment and now he has 4 people working under him.  He has a brand new 2020 truck.  Owns his own house.  Is looking at buying a new Tesla.  Is looking at buying a rental house.  All because he likes talking to people and doesn't take no for an answer.  And some how in the end, despite being kind of asshole-ish and pushy, people like him.  Despite getting his way, at the expense of others, people still like him.  

I wish I could be those people."
299,depression,Are online depression tests/quizzes a reliable indication?,"Ive been feeling really down past few months. I got worried and googled and the websites suggested i take a test to check if i might be depressed. I checked on 4 different websites and they all said i have mild to severe depression.

My only hope is someone as screwed up as I am if not more so. A lot of guys have no problem taking care of women with a lot of problems.

308,depression,It really hurts to find out in counseling just how useless you are,"I am at a loss of what to do at this point, it's as if I've reached a wall that I can't even begin to comprehend how to climb. I've come to some harsh realizations over the course of this year, I've excepted that up until now I have really just coasted through life thinking everything will just fall into place. I've excepted that I am a lazy bum who leeches off of everyone around him and I've excepted that I treat people like shit and expect the opposite in return. I know what you're thinking ""classic sheltered white boy with basic commonsense problems"" and you're 100% correct this is all just basic life skills that you learn in grade school. I can see this post just becoming a lost user post with a link to a subreddit for cringe or white trash. I've been spending this year attempting to better myself and just collectively get my shit together, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm the poster boy for the fat neck beard with a clean your room lobster poster on his wall. In the end all this 'struggle' I've gone through to lose lose 50 pounds in 7 months, take care of my mental health and treat myself like a person. It's all childish common sense in comparison to all the people who are actually struggling with unemployment and debt or a crippling disease and yet still going on. To get to the point for whoever is still reading I've been seeing a councilor, and to be clear it's only been two session so far. After finishing the second session it just hurts to hear that the only advice I got was go for a walk once a day. More specifically it is mean't that I need more vitamin d, what hurts is that in the end I can't even exist properly. When I told the counselor that I am very introverted and tend to stay inside a sigh of disapproval followed and they replied, ""you need vitamin d try going for a walk 30 minutes a day"" and I could tell in the tone that they were checked out at this point as all they were doing was explaining basic common sense. It was like I was just read like a book and they already knew everything they needed to know just business as usual. To finally get back to the wall I spoke about at the beginning it's the wall of what the heck am I going to do next?"
309,depression,I find comfort in negative feelings,"Since I was kid, I’ve always experienced heavy stress, anger, sadness; happiness and relaxation just seem like such bizarre and foreign concepts, and I never feel safe when I’m either.

313,depression,I need advice...," I'm a 32 M, my situation is a bit complicated and I don't want to go too much into details but I grew up with abusive parents more specifically my father. 

It certainly had its effect on me, besides me having severe depression and PTSD I've also learnt bad behaviours. 

Basically what I mean is I was abusive as well. I didn't know I was being abusive. Not until things got physical...

Once it got to that point I realized and there was something wrong with me. 

The relationship I was in ended. And I don't blame her, I didn't treat her right, she didn't deserve the way I treated her. And because I treated her this way I didn't deserve to be with her.

Since that event a year ago, I've taken many self-help classes. Some online others in person. 

I've taken 3 anger management classes depression management class stress management class I've taken partners assault response program.- P.A.R ( Advance if you're in the U.s ) relationship classes, CBT- cognitive behavioral therapy. I've taken other online classes about abuse and abusive relationships. And a few other classes on mental health and mental illness as well as classes on learnt behavior. 

With all that being said I also went to my family doctor who has referred me to a psychiatrist/ psychologist who diagnosed me with severe recurring depression and post-traumatic stress disorder from childhood trauma.. 

I've been medicated (Zoloft)since a week after the incident last year. 

I've also been to a counsellor as well as free online counselling since covid hit. 

I also look up any websites or books that I can read to improve not only my mental health but correct my negative learned behaviour. 

With everything that I've done in the past year, I still feel like it's not enough that I can still learn more and do more for myself. 

I don't ever, ever want to hurt or abuse in anyway anyone again especially the woman that I love or my children.

I've looked into parenting classes ( since we have a child together) but this was before covid hit and online in a bit difficult to find.

For those who are wondering, the police where involved and there's a no contact order between us and I haven't spoken to her since or met my new born child... 

Like I said it's complicated.

I was just wondering if there's anything else I could do to help me out??? 

I know that this might upset some people since I'm both the victim of abuse and was abusive...

I just want advice on what I should do next. And trust me, I still feel like shit for everything that I've done. Even if I didn't know any better it's still not right what I did."
314,depression,FML,"Can I just die?
That's just how I feel right now."
315,depression,I think Covid broke me,"I’m 21, and in college. I’ve had some pretty bad depression for a couple years, but I had managed to coast, but ever since this year it’s really cemented that I’m deeply lonely. All of the online classes have made me realize how much I miss interacting with people in person. I hate my job, but I’ve been working it a bunch just to get some social interaction; because, I’m starting to feel insane in my depression. Talking to someone I genuinely like just kinda brings me back to reality.

I find myself really jealous of other people’s relationships with people lately. I see friends family’s who have healthy relationships with their family. I never knew my dad, and my mom has anger problems so I just grew up scared and resentful of her as a kid. I have a younger sister, but we’re not that close. My relationship with my family has gotten better, but I don’t feel comfortable around them still. I haven’t had any romantic relationships for 2 years. I feel like I need to find one, but I haven’t found much luck there. I feel like I’ve strained my friendships these past few years, because of depression. And hysterical moments because of that. I feel like the circle of people I know is just getting smaller. I wish I had better relationships during this time. I regret a lot of the decisions I’ve made these past few years, and I wish I could go back to repair things. It’s too late with a lot of them.

I guess the point if all this is I feel really alone right now. I think a lot of people do. Covid has put me in a weird situation where I really want to get out and meet people, but I can’t really. I just really wish I was close to someone right now. I feel like it would make it easier. 

I really hope the world gets better from the he’ll we are in right now. I hope the people in this subreddit find what they need and get better. Life’s hard right now and I think everyone needs some relief. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this."
316,depression,Topics you want to see discussed more,"Hi everyone I hope you’re all doing well and staying safe. I’ve started a YouTube channel and done some reddit live-streams talking about mental illness and my experiences, particularly with MDD, GAD, anorexia nervosa and OCD as well as hospitalisations, ECT and TMS. Mainly I just want to help end the stigma against mental illness and maybe help others to reach out. What are some topics you’d like to see spoken about more in the public, or some truths about mental illness more people need to know? Thanks everyone, stay well"
317,depression,I like you,"Me: * Confesses to my crush. *

318,depression,I just want to feel something nice.,"I don’t want to die, I just want to go to sleep and not wake up."
319,depression,"Love you, hate me?","Here's a news flash to me that is probably known by everyone.  I have always been focused on how I don't like myself when I am depressed.  I just noticed that I don't like anyone else much either.  Makes sense I think.  I am surprised it took me this long to figure this out.  Sadly, I bet those I love have felt it."
320,depression,Doubts of Diagnosis,"After having a couple hard months at work and a noticeable change in my moods, I figured I would look into counselling to see if I can get some help coping. I went last week, to which she diagnosed me with severe major depression (without psychosis) and general anxiety.

I didn't think I had that much trouble? Sure, I expected a diagnosis of maybe minor depression, but definitely not severe? I'm not sad ALL the time. And I don't ever have thoughts of killing myself. I have been having issues with motivation, cleaning, cooking, working, etc. And I've been in a slump when it comes to finding something to do (my usual hobbies of gaming and reading aren't giving me any enjoyment lately). Granted, I have been experiencing a lot of workplace stress, but it seems reasonable given the circumstance. 

Am I just downplaying what I'm going through? Or has the counselor maybe misdiagnosed me?"

322,depression,I don’t really want to die,"The other night I made a post about how I wished I would die in my sleep. I did feel that way then; I feel that way a lot of nights. But the reality is I don’t really wish I was dead. I **want** to live. I **want** to find happiness. I hear stories like loved ones dying or for example tonight Chadwick Boseman and all I think is, life is so short, I want to do things, I want to *make something of it*.

But the problem is I feel so stuck right now. I feel like I’m going nowhere; I don’t know what I’m going to do with my life, I don’t know where I’m going to live, I don’t have any money, I don’t have a career I want to go into. And on top of that all the world is just so shitty. My home country is falling apart, and so is the country I live in now. Global warming’s ruining the planet. 

I don’t know. It’s just really shitty. I feel like life is *so fucking short* and I only get this one shot and as much as I may say it *dying fucking terrifies me*. 

I just want to feel better."
323,depression,I have to go back to school next week and it fucking sucks,"Next week i have to go back to school and while everyone is very happy to be able to see eachover again i would just rather crawl up and die.....

Before lockdown began i was kinda new to the school as I'd only been there for a term (semester) and while i was happy to be getting on with life i struggled to make new make friends and find places to ""fit in"" and places where i felt accepted. 

Another guy started the same time as me and within a week it was like he had know people there for years, i didn't know what i had done wrong. I just feel like people don't like being around me and while i enjoy others company i just want to feel that people like me for me and not have to portray some fucking uptight ""cool kid"" to be noticed. 

When i do start back it'll be a new school ""year"" and the start of my GCSE course (final grade exams). While I'll be happy to finally complete the shithole that is school, i constantly feel rejected and that no one wants me around.

I don't want to have to attempt to socialise with people who i can tell clearly don't fucking like me. I didn't know where to express my thoughts and feelings so i turned to reddit....."
324,depression,I’m useless annnnd rEAlly dumb,Useless to myself and the world and nothing will ever change that haha i can’t feel shit. But it makes sense so that’s why ig I don’t feel the pain anymore. Finding reasoning in the pain always helps. I’m weak and dumb so I suffer and the more I try at anything I’m bound to fail and be left unsatisfied so I suffer even more. So I just won’t strive for more anymore. I’m already a piece of shit already so I won’t make things worse yeah
325,depression,I don't have the courage to live,"I've been a coward my whole life. Too afraid to try, too afraid to fail. Too afraid to move on. Always playing safe. And I know I can't be like this forever, whether I like it or not, I will be force to face the world. And I'm afraid I'm not ready for it. No matter how much time I give myself, I won't be ready, and I'm afraid I don't have much time left. 

""If you never try you never improve""
""It's normal to fail, you just have to learn from past mistakes""
""It's too early to give up, it's never too late to start""
""The outcome doesn't matter, what's important is you  do the best""
""Practice makes perfect""
""Instead of doubting yourself, why not actually do it, even if you fail, you can always try again""
""Incapable does not mean impossible""
ETC 


I have heard enough, and I understand everything they said, but I lack the guts and the strength. No matter how much motivational quotes I read, I just want to run away. I don't have anything that give me courage. I don't have anyone by me. I'm all alone, and I'm not strong enough to do this by myself. 

The only things that have always stay with me are all fictional. Which only makes me sound more pathetic. 
All I have are them, they make me feel better, I feel warmth from them. They filled my void. 

When I'm lost and discouraged, it's always the fictional characters and story that give me strength, give me hope. But whenever I look at reality, I only realise how empty I am. Which makes me wonder, are all the hopes delusional? Are all the fictions just fake? Well of course they are, but the message in those? What am I living for? 

Now things are getting worse, even just playing games make me depressed. The joy and the strength it used to give me aren't there anymore. Now there is nothing left for me. I'm truly empty and alone now. There's nobody I can reach for help, that's why I can only rant on internet. 

I used to think I don't belong anywhere in real life. That's why I escape into fantasy. Now I even don't belong in fantasy. Where should I go?"
327,depression,I don't know if I'm depressed,"Hello
I'm 18 and in the army, and I'm basically always sad i guess. It's been that way for a few years now. Even at times where im very happy, if it goes on for too long i start thinking about shit things about my life. I used to cut myself and stopped, and I've never been in a romantic relationship. Im afraid if i get close to that the other one sould find out and it'll end up badly. 

I work out (mostly in the army, but i used to before as well) and my body looks good, but it didn't help at all, and it's not like i can show it off or something because of the scars from cutting myself. My older brother tells me we were abused but i don't know if that's true. I feel like having a girlfriend would solve all of my problems, but my brain knows it isn't true. On top of that, i think i would be a really bad boyfriend because of lack of experience and because i just think I'm a shitty guy. I think my hobbies would stop girls from wanting to get to know me since they are weird. I barely see anyone because i come home about once every three weeks for a couple days and corona, i just want to go to parties and meet new people but i don't know how.

I used to have a small group of very close friends, but since i got drafted we're getting further and further away and i feel like there's no one i can share my problems with except for my brother, who can't really help me to be honest. I don't know what to do, I don't know if I'm looking for an answer, i guess im just letting stuff out. 

Thank you for reading if you did. Have a good day.

Edit: it shows that the thread has comments but i can't see them? Is this a technical problem?"

329,depression,i would do anything if it meant you were happy,i feel like i’m finally beginning to find happiness. but it fucking hurts me so much to see my best friend in the same dark place i was in before. i don’t think i’ve ever met someone who clicked with me as much as her. i would give her every ounce of happiness in me if i knew it would make her happy. i feel like finding my happiness is leaving her in the dark. i don’t know what to do. i just want her to be happy i don’t care about anything else right now. i would spend the rest of my life depressed and miserable if i could make her happy
330,depression,Not sure what I should do,"Its been a little while since I've posted on this sub, I don't visit often.

I guess I'm looking for advice or some kind of comfort, I'm kind of running out of time. I do deal with a major depression, I've been in therapy for a little over a year but recently stopped as I could not get along with my therapist, as for medicine I used to take some consistently but I don't any longer as my depression has been growing to the point where I either feel completely stale and uncaring or painfully sad and negative. 

I've been unemployed for about a year now, my truck payments cause me extreme anxiety due to my own inability to hold a job, my friend wants a roommate when he finishes college but he seem's to want someone else instead now since I'm ""lame."" I recently left my group of online friends as it was becoming very apparent that I'm annoying to them and that they found weed more important than group activities, so I'm mostly alone now.

So, I'm here with my family who tolerate me though I often get ""You should get a job you would feel better"" which is very much not the case, my last job causing very heavy distress, sadness, and a few attempts. Hopefully something happens soon but I doubt it. I might pack up my bags and just leave, become homeless, and be myself."

i love to play games,RPG games to be exact.but i feel its like a chore to play games just to make sure for me not to think about my miserable life.

i cant even talk about it to anyone because i know i will just burst in insulting mode and thats why i cant contact anyone.not even my brother.Only my mother know my condition but i dont want to trouble her anymore since she already have depression and a lot more in her plate.

currently i just sleep whenever i can,like a video player,i just want to skip the next day. sometimes i sleep for 1 hour,sometime 7 hour.cant sleep and able to sleep at any moment.

pretty sure every day and every night,i just wish to end all of this but i dont dare to end it by my own hands.sometime i just hope someone end it for me.sometime i even wish it in my sleep"
333,depression,Smiles are alien to me,I do't smile all that often.. I just wanted to say that for whatever reason when I see myself smile I don't recognize myself. It also makes me feel hollow and like my face is a mask. I don't recognize my face when it smiles. It seems... Off. I then typically get very depressed for a while after seeing my smile. It makes being happy pretty inconvenient.
334,depression,I don’t know how to open about this.,"As of now I have submitted a coding test with nothing on it because I didn’t really know what to do. I tried asking a subbredit to read over and point out if I did something wrong or just help me out and then after get a full paragraph banter of how I am just telling them to do my work. But I really did not meant it that way! I just really needed help and was to scared to ask the teacher because the last time I asked they just told me to just go and try it even though I showed plenty of my attempts at doing so, and I don’t want to tell my classmates because they seem to know what they are doing and feel like I would get the same shame like I would with the one user that bantered. And now I am just nervous? I don’t know right now I just can’t think straight and I don’t want to have the dark thoughts but it just might come to that, thoughts?"
335,depression,What are the most important things I can't and I can do to fight severe depression?,"I was diagnosed with this mental illness some time ago. I'm struggling, it's exhausting me and each second passes, the lower chance of me being succesful in life. Is it possible to try to read books or make music when I'm in this state? I don't have vitality to do this anymore, but maybe if I'll force myself to it, I'll like it and it will be a small step towards success? I already know having friends is a good thing. I can't have friends at this state, unfortunately."
336,depression,Became a loser after losing interest in life,"Im a woman in mid 20s. I started getting depressed and developed body dysmorphia about 5years ago... and from then on, I literally let go of everything in life. Its like.. I spent those years being in a coma when my body was perfectly functional.  The thing is, I just didnt care. I lost interest in myself, living felt meaningless. I don't know if its even possible to pick myself up from here. I already lost at life. I cant even dare to meet new people or be in a relationship because of how ashamed I am at the way I lived my life so far. My lifestyle was utterly trash.. I want to be better but at the same time I don't care about myself. I don't love who I am. I can't get over this immense shame I have over myself. I feel too embarrassed and too much like a loser to be alive."
337,depression,"I’m not lazy, I’m just depressed","I hate taking on responsibilities, because I know that sooner or later my depression and anxiety will act up, and I will be unable to take care of whatever I signed up for, which is usually anything people ask of me, because I’m a people pleaser and can’t say no.

I end up with extreme guilt, further escalating my depressive episode, making it even harder to do anything.

People probably think I’m lazy, I know I would, and it’s so extremely limiting. I also can’t go around telling everyone that I’m in bed in a dark room struggling with mental illness.

Has anyone else had this problem? And what do you do to avoid it?"

I keep trying to find fun in my art and it's just gone. I don't know how to find it again. I feel so empty."
340,depression,Video games has been a crutch for my depression for years. So I finally decided to quit them.,"I’ve used video games as a crutch for my depression for way too long. Prob played 5-6 hours a day for 2+ years. Whenever I would feel really depressed, I would play for hours straight and temporarily feel better about myself. But really the games were just an escape from reality/my problems, and overall I know it was making my depression worse. 
A few weeks ago, I figured I’d take a break from the gaming and see if my depression would get any better. Well it has and I wish I had quit (or limited) my video game playing awhile ago. I have more free time, feel much more productive and feel I can face my depression head on. Nice to know I’ve crossed one crutch off the list.

Edit: this is just my experience. There are certainly people that can play video games 12 hours a day and be completely happy. However, if you are feeling depressed and that you are over indulging in video games as a way to feel better about yourself, I would certainly recommend taking a break and seeing how you feel."
341,depression,Have to go back to school on Monday,"I just hate my life and my mom is being an over academic bitch too. Been depressed since December 2018 and it’s only gone away like a few times this summer and basically all of last summer. Aside from that it’s just non stop. And the little cherry on top is my grandpa dying on July 3rd, which made my favorite holiday depressing. I miss him so much. School is the source of all of my depression and my school has absolutely no mental health cares. If school didn’t exist I’d actually be happy"
342,depression,I think I'm unconsciously giving up,"I just don't do anything by myself to keep me well anymore.

I don't eat because the pain in my stomach isn't that bad compared to how I feel in general. 
I stay up all night because of insomnia and end up always sleeping less than 6 hours, but I feel tired all the time so it doesn't matter. 
I don't remember the last time I had a shower nor did my hair. 
I don't avoid physical damage and just let it happen.
I stopped almost entirely doing any of my hobbies* and when I do them, they don't bring me the joy they used to give me.

The only thing I do is cleaning my kitten's litter, my dog's cages and feed them all, give them showers and pet them. Clean my house sometimes so my mom doesn't make me feel useless, and that's basically it.

I'm mostly numb all the time but at times the smallest thing makes me cry for hours.

I miss liking living so much."
343,depression,Zinc cured my depression,"A couple of weeks ago, I was feeling horribly depressed to the point of thinking about suicide daily, as well as feeling really on edge and anxious. I watched a video where someone suggested zinc for depression, so I bought some zinc with copper tablets. I took one one evening, the next morning I felt what I'd describe as really stable and normal. I've been on them since for a couple weeks and I haven't had any of the issues I had before taking them, I've felt really happy actually. I was really surprised, because I feel I eat a really balanced and healthy diet, but it's said that 25% of the world's population is at risk of zinc deficiency. 

Felt like posting as it could help others out there who are suffering. Not saying it will help everyone it just really really helped me for some reason :)"
344,depression,I'm confused," I don't understand...I get bad depression and when I actually get better my partner distances herself from me saying I been treating her like crap...I like ""I'm sorry I was depressed but let's work together to fix this"" nope she's going out to drink and won't talk to me...wtf did i do... I feel so alone now...the two people j care about the most is distancing themselves from me and idk what I did..I have Depression cause I'm obsessed with my ex to the point I'd kill myself if he wasn't around anymore...and...I'm getting through that..I actually feel some what better and my current partner just says after talking to her of future plans on how to fix all this says ""I'm going out, with another friend. Is there anything else you want to say before I go?"" And I told her that I love her and to please please stay safe cause she's going out to drink and she just says ""Ok, I'll call you in a few days. Take care"" I don't know what to do anymore..."
345,depression,Insignificant,"Hi all, I don't really have a place to go so I thought I would pour a little diary entry out for the day here since I actually need an outlet this time.

Does anyone ever just feel that they are second rate and pretty insignificant to everyone around them? As if, no one would come looking for you first for your opinion and actually even if you gave it, it wouldn't matter. My sister didn't show me her new tattoo, but everyone else has seen it. Seems a bit ridiculous but when you're already paranoid that your feelings on anything are second rate and irrelevant, stuff like that checks the box pretty easy.

I was in a very good mood... I had a great day at work and came home ready and excited for two days off, and now I am just sobbing because my sister for whatever reason didn't bother to text me a pic of her new tattoo. 

At this point I'm beginning to think if I just stopped talking completely and acted like I wasn't there, it would be better for everyone involved."

350,depression,Understand the cycle,"I truly believe depression can be mitigated to a very dull ache without medication. If you can master exercise sleep and diet, meditation and focus on learning about mental health. 

That being said, I have depression and it's easier said than done. Its helpful to take it one step at a time. Also easier said than done. But you have to keep trying because the more you chip away at the ice, the weaker it will become as a whole.

I just want to touch on sleep and how it personally affects me. I've always been a slight insomniac, and falling asleep typically takes me about and hour to hour and a half. 

I saw a post from someone mentioning how they delve into video games and reading and other time consuming activities to not feel depression. What's happening there is that you are hiding some factors that are currently enhancing your feelings of depression, by allowing your mind to wander elsewhere.

This is the problem with sleep. When you finally will and allow your mind to settle, your underlying negative thoughts begin to resurface,  as nothing is blocking them anymore. You try and push them away, to clear your mind, but many nights you lose the battle and spend too many hours sitting there thinking and fighting a battle you can't win. This is what happens to me, personally anyways.  It's gotten to the point where I spend a lot of time trying to clear my mind that I actually have had a steady migraine for a couple weeks now, which feels like the back of my mind is being slightly squeezed. 

The psychology of staying awake until you are completely exhausted i believe is due to this reason. You subconsciously are aware that silence is pain, and even though you desire sleep and know it will make you feel better the next day if you rest correctly, your anxiety manages to prioritize you feeling good now rather than invest in the you of tomorrow. 

As you can see, it's a paradox and a cycle that needs to be broken. I don't have an answer, but I do believe it's necessary to understand every part of your bad habits and why you do them, and you will begin to realize ways to work around them and ultimately conquer them. 

Like I said, one step at a time, and that doesnt necessarily mean one physical step at a time, as the mental is what drives the physical."

354,depression,Is it wrong to feel like you're hurting?,"This is the first time that I have ever posted anything on a site so I'm kinda nervous about saying anything. Anyway, I have been through hell, and whenever I want to complain about it. I stop myself because I feel like I'm this selfish person who doesn't appreciate what people have done to help me. I can't even express it without someone telling me that my words don't matter.  I tried to hold in my emotions and act as if nothing bothers me when I want to scream out loud that I'm in pain. I remember that one day, I wrote a note that talks all about feeling alone and that I could leave for months and come back but no one would ever notice that I was gone. I never planned on letting anyone see it but I made the mistake of leaving it on a table. My older brother found it and thought that I was going to kill myself. Ever since that day my father had given me hell by treating me like a was a terrible daughter, my best friend couldn't accept the fact that I was no longer a happy person and my mom couldn't understand that she had a part of making me feel like I'm nothing. I don't want to continue writing or otherwise, I might be here all day talking about something that brings me so much pain. This was just a rant that I've wanted to say for so long."

Always chose his family before us , even tho they hurt us many times and put us in a lot of problems. I was so glad I went away for uni so that I don’t have to deal with him anymore but he started doin the same to my siblings and hurting my mom more and more . I always tried to forgive him and say that’s he’s still my father but today he  just kicked my siblings and my mom.

isn't it ironic how emptiness could be so heavy?

I really want to die now c:"
360,depression,I’m tired of this,I really hate being alive I made so many mistakes and hung around bad people. I hate it here so much. Two years ago someone stole my cell phone  and I didn’t do anything about it. They were taking my atm card and using it and stole 380 dollars from me. They charged food to my account. They stole my shoes. My clothes. While I was in the mental hospital. I wish I would got them in trouble. I have looked back on their socials and seen them with my phone using it. I did file a police report but I never called and reported the phone stolen through the phone company. So they were able to use it once I stopped paying. This person threatened to have someone violently beat me up. They took advantage of me. I don’t know why it’s bothering me after two years. I have talked to a therapist but it is not helping. There is no proof he used my cArd by the way the gas station says the video erases after three days.
361,depression,Somebody hold me,I just want a big strong man to hold me and tell me I’m going to be okay...just one time before I go. I’m so sick of waiting and I feel like fucking shit.
362,depression,I don't want to do anything,"I don't want to try 
I don't want to fix myself 
I don't want to exist"
363,depression,I don't want to be here,"I really don't... I feel more and more lonely all the time. I cry all the time. I just want to sleep all the time..

I'm so fkn miserable it's unreal"
364,depression,Week 3 on antidepressants,"I’ve noticed I’ve been feeling pretty numb to most situations, finally was able to remove all the toxic people in my without even breaking down or worrying. It’s really early, so it’s most likely placebo.

Its really strange feeling content since just before taking medications I was crying almost everyday. 

Today. , I have a date with this guy just met and I’m worried i may come off as something negative. Maybe I should reschedule the date until I can talk to my doctor and perhaps change my dosage. I know I’m not myself at the moment and I don’t wanna push him away."
365,depression,Maybe i am losing it,"I am always overthinking, i always trying to figure out the meaning of a deed, sorry i am not native English so maybe it is not the correct word.

And i think thats the problem, keeping thinking and thinking and thinking argg, piss me off but i dont know how to shut it down. Maybe it has to do

that i am unsure about myself, not loving myself the way i am. I also think my body needs to do what i want, not other way around, so maybe this is the problem. Really dont know. Its like i am in a roller coaster that never breaks, but i dont have any thoughts of harming or whatever to other people, so thats a plus.

But it is a real struggle, its like i am really not satisfied with myself, to accept how i am. I am from blood Polish, christian.

Now why i do say that is, i am not married. BUT i did think about marriage and i am ok that i am not. But i do know that when i talk with people i always say my girlfriend and where i live it is usual. BUT i need mostly to rethink why i say that and because we are not married. Just trying to figure out why i am like me at this moment, with those negative feelings and sometimes thinking about leaving, so i would not be any burden to other people, really dont know.

Just trying to understand  what the hell is going on. I dont want to exit, just trying to solve my problem that i have, but its very hard when you are in a negative thought that keeps going and going like the brake is broken, i really would like to have people to be trained to recognise a mental issue with somebody and try to help you you know. try to connect with those people. But then again i would be afraid to open up because of the thought what if they think i need to go to a hospital....

I work as security agent in a house with older people in Saguenay, Quebec Canada. Would not want to live there because i feel its not you have a real live. Now with the Covid-19 measure in place, activities for those people are very very minimal. There is always a guy coming downstair, call him Mr niceguy, the only one is allowed to do so, but only after 16:00 hours. God he is so so so gentle. Now this is a French province, so i am also learning Quebecoise, and its a pain in the but. Trying to communicate with people when you have problems with your thoughts is a big struggle. But at least where i work, people are very very polite, really like that. Now with Mr Niceguy, he tries to make a conversation with me but he talks really quiet so mostly i dont get what he is talking about. I do understand that for him its what i write before, sitting just in his room with tv, he has a problem with that. Before he had all kind of stuff going on, a lot of activities so he was busy every day and he was busy for 5 a 6 hours a day, he really misses it. Working keeps me a bit busy, i do still have a lot of thoughts but when i am there i can focus a bit more on the work so it gives me a bit of happiness that i am doing something to help other people sort off. I think without work i would me more miserable..

Dont know what to think about myself,  maybe I am really fucked up. But ouff, dont know you know there are some people young and old that need  guidance/help with some stuff. I did ask for therapy so eventually i will get professional help. Today i started a bigger dose of celexa, so we will see if it will be more effective, hope so. But i can understand that people are afraid of the unknown, so thats propably why they wont try to cennect with you because what if i say something wrong....

Sometimes I really could  just cry and cry, although its hard to open up like that because of fear to be seen as broken, to emotional. even for me to really cry its hard because of a feeling that i am failure as a man. I trying to stay strong, at least from the outside, just pretend everything is fine, and sometimes it is. 

I overthink everything, constantly thinking about past/future what i could have said or done. Trying to watch a liveset with music, sometimes i can follow it so i am able to just think on one thing at that time but mostly a lot of thoughts all day long.

Think i focus on things so i wont get in the negative compulsive thoughts train of fear how people see me, that i am not normal? and that how much i want to be seen as normal, that i am nuts or whatever. Fear of losing contact with people around me and my job just because of that, because you notice when people avoid you or dont want to talk to you and that triggers thinking about what if i am nuts, dont want to end up in a psychic ward of whatever then what??, and this makes me afraid of our future.

I now understand why people try to hurt themselves, to stop their thought just to exit their thoughts they are used to to have different thought for a bit. Maybe somebody should beat me up so I would get back with to feet on earth lol

366,depression,Is this fate?,"For the last years I've had no motivation. I am 22M and suffer from a lot of physical things (most of it is undiagnosed but I know from family history and how I feel I have them) I don't have motivation to change my life. 

Throughout the years I've had opportunities to change my life but I never had the motivation to go through any of them. In the end its either lack of fear, lack of support network etc that stopped me. Now I'm supposed to be in the prime of my life and have nothing to show for it. 

Due to the person I am if I were to search for socialization I would only encounter people I would hate. Even though i hate myself I have this weird inferiority complex. I have such niche interests that the only people I would encounter are people that I know for sure I think less of. I dont know how to word it properly but they are people I cant stand and due the person I am if I were to get better then that's who I have to settle for unfortunately. 

I've been thinking about killing myself for years now. About 6 maybe more ive been in this state of mind. The method of suicide is still in the process. I would like to get my gun and go my way while doing some other things but in reality I just might hang myself with a belt? The process of getting better i don't know. If life really does get better than it would've by now. 

Then I think its fate. I'm fated to end up this way. I would like to do things my way and go out with a bang but I just might die in my room."
367,depression,My mom asked for my gf to do more around the house at the wrong time.,"Me and her live at my parents house. Lately she has been really depressed. 

My parents and I have been working a lot lately and she has been at home. The house has been neglected and it’s obvious. 

My mom approached us both, not in a mean way, to help out more around the house. She was aiming more toward my gf, but me as well since I too am living here. It was more like “we’re tired, and we’d like some help on our long days, like trash, dog poop, and dishwasher. We love you guys and enjoy having you here, but we’re tired”. She also added that my dad will get mad because they work all day and he has to come home to pick up dog poop and throw away trash. 

Gf has a hard time getting out of bed every day. She’s upset that my mom asked her to do stuff since she’s home all day. 

Now she’s in bed and mad at me because I didn’t tell her they were thinking this. They’ve never mentioned anything to me. But I’ve mentioned to her that we should keep our stuff cleaner since we are living here. She replies with “I’m a messy person. That’s how I live”

I don’t know what to do."
368,depression,I just can't go on anymore.,"I am so tired and sick of my crapy life I have made for myself.Because of my failure in past jobs and now broke and so depressed it's been this way for to long.

I have looked for and applied for a job everyday with no response also feel like I cannot deal with life anymore and Covid does not help.I don't know how to hang on as there is nothing to hang on to."
369,depression,I’ve been desperately craving for change.,"Lately i’ve been craving for change so much (and this was even before the pandemic) its just, i want my brain to feel something different, asides from sadness or nothing at all. 

I want to be excited or (gosh i wish, i so damn wish) happiness. I’ve watched series, i’ve tried new hobbies. Nothing makes me feel that adrenaline rush. 

And the fact that we are amidst a pandemic makes it worse. 
Plus my family is so strict with this. I havent stepped out since 5 months. 

I wake up everyday, get bored, eat, surf the repetitive net and sleep. 

At this point my brains preferring dreams over being awake cause at least that has something new. 

I don’t know what to do. I cant go out at all. I wish i could but my parents wont allow me (its even worse knowing i am 21 and still am treated like a kid) 

I really want to get over this. Its driving me insane. I’ve lost the will to live. Or purpose to exist. 

What do i do?"
370,depression,Ugh the search for a therapist continue,"I have sit through multiple sessions of being told to look at various medical treatments for solving my depression. This was my first so honestly I let it go way longer than it should.

I stated on day one I wanted to learn techniques to deal with the issues never taught me any.

Thankfully I have a friend who has already been through the hunt for a compatible therapist.

Telling myself keep at it you deserve someone who will address your needs in therapy"
371,depression,Another day,All week I’ve been telling myself I wasn’t going to be a lazy piece of shit this weekend and that I was going to get out of the house and be productive and do something. It’s almost 4pm and I have sat in the couch all day. Have no desire to do anything. I hate being this way
372,depression,Thank you,"The past few months have been really hard, and I'm realizing that I've been depressed and anxious for a long time. For some reason it didn't occur to me until today to see if there were Reddit communities I could join to find some solidarity. Within minutes of being here I was getting emotional, seeing others who truly understand, and it's so incredibly validating. One of my biggest struggles is worrying that I'm no worse off than anyone else, that I'm just being lazy, and not trying hard enough. So thank you all for the reassurance, it has turned a really bad day into an only somewhat bad day. 🖤"
373,depression,I want to die,"The realization has never been stronger. It is so strong that i feel cold. So cold that it burns. I really want to die. Not change my current situation, not to be happy, not anything. I just want to die. And yet I don't know how. I know things can't change and yet I can't bring myself to do it. I am just waiting to die. If I could just lie down and never get up again I would. I've seen life and I just don't like it. Being brought to this world was just an act of massive selfishness. I don't like anything. So why do I have to work and survive? For what? Just for my parents? This is just so fucked up. I hope one of these days, I'll get cancer or something and die. I'm to much of a coward to do it myself."
374,depression,"I really, really regret doing nothing","I have no experiences, no friends, and nothing to show for the 21 years I've been alive. The last 5 or 6 years went by so quickly in a blur of feeling nothing and just doing the bare minimum.

I didn't really intend to still be alive by now, and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I've been trying to get better for a few years but nothing has helped. I've wasted so much time feeling shitty and doing nothing"
375,depression,"The moment you're born average or below, you're fucked.","This rat race started wayyyyy before you're born. No amount of hard work will allow you to compete evenly against those with tons of resources. Unless you're a girl or is EXTREMELY good-looking, it's all going downhill the moment you fertilize the egg. Capitalism just exposes how shitty you really are relative to society. The more you know, the more depressed you'll get."
376,depression,Does anyone else feel this way or am I just lazy?,One of my biggest problems now a days is going to work. I love my job and everyone here but I just HATE being here and the thought of going to work the next day makes me cry. I just want to stay at home all day everyday. When I am at work I can’t stop counting down the hours and always request to leave early. This is obviously an issue and I’m so annoyed at myself. Why can’t I just be normal and go to work like everyone else.
377,depression,Would I be an asshole for checking into a psych ward without telling my dad?,"I am planning to section myself into a psych ward because my depression is getting the best of me and I am starting not to trust myself. I’m a frequent flyer to psych wards so it’s nothing new. The only difference this time is that I don’t want to tell anyone I’m going until I’m already there. Especially my dad. 
The reason I don’t want to tell my dad is because A. He will try to tell me that I don’t need help that all I have to do is “think positive, pray and follow god” (I am not religious btw so this means absolutely nothing to me)

B. He will think it’s a good idea but will start nagging me about when I’m going to go. I already have a plan with a day picked out for when I’m going to go and I am comfortable with this plan. I am confident in myself that I will actually go through with it. So the last thing I need is for him to breath down my neck every five minutes about it. 

Or C. He will tell his wife and one or both of them will start lecturing me about how they were able to stay working and functional while they had depression and make me feel like I’m weak because I can’t do it the way they did it.

The reason I know he will say these things is because every time I’ve tried to get help in the past these are always the things he says. He doesn’t understand that depression is different for everyone. Hes always saying things like “you won’t need medication if you pray and follow Jesus and the Bible” but I believe that I do need medication because when I’m not on my meds (which I’m not right now) I feel so irrational and crazy. And I’m not just struggling with depression but also severe anxiety and paranoia.

Today’s Saturday and I plan on going on Wednesday so I would only have to keep it to myself for a few more days. The only reason I feel bad is because it might hurt his feelings when he finds out that I didn’t want to tell him. But I just don’t want to risk him causing me to feel less motivated or more guilty about wanting to get help. 

Please let me know if you think that it does make me an asshole for hiding this from my dad or if you agree that I’ll probably be better off not telling him ahead of time."
378,depression,Does live get better?,"Hi,

I'm 23. I've lost my girlfriend. I don't have any money. I don't have a plan. I'm completely lost. I have more motivation to take cyanide than to stand up from my bed.


I'm nothing and failed so many times in my life. I have no reason to live. I'd hope that I'd be able to be better at some point but I'm done. Like literally done. 

I stopped believing in God, stopped believing in any love. Everything seems to be about money. And I'm tired of chasing anything. 

I have no clue what to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore, nothing."
379,depression,I feel like a failure in life,"I have bad high school grades UK and a dead end job in security and I got kicked out the army for ‘depression’ I want to find a new job or career but I just can’t... I feel like life is boring and repetitive. I live on my own and all my money goes on rent and my cars breaking, my life is a mess I need guidance and support but I don’t know where to go..."
380,depression,it doesn't feel real,"Ive been spiralling the last couple of days. I've been in an extremely bad mental head space, I'm so exhuasted being like this. I have two people in my life who're my support group. My best friend and my s/o. They try to make me feel better and remind me that I'm not alone, that I'm loved, that theyll always be there for me, that I don't need to struggle alone, but my brain is playing me. I'm being drowned with these thoughts that they don't give a shit, they don't care, that I'm literally so insignificant to them, that they don't mean what they say. I'm letting these thoughts win cause I'm believing it more and more everytime. I'm tired of existing and feeling worthless"
381,depression,Feeling like a failure,"I had a lot of plans for this weekend, but I stayed in bed until 2 pm. 

I feel like my soul is broken and even if I try hard I will never be able to fix it. At times like this, I wonder why I keep trying.

Nothing has ever worked before, now that depression has made my mind confused and turned me into a retard, why should I believe that anything will work?

Not that I blame anyone for my failures, I'm solely responsible for it. Even though I was doing my best, I was never enough.

I need a shoulder to cry on, but a lonely loser can't have that."
382,depression,I feel like i cant go to my family for help with anything,Everytime i try to tell them how im feeling they dont seem to care. Whenever i need help with something they get mad at me and dont want to help me. I feel worthless.
383,depression,Ugh this sucks l,"I’m so done. I’m sick of crying myself to sleep every night. I’m sick of living in a pig sty because I don’t have the motivation to clean. I’m sick of having bad teeth because I can’t seem to find the will to brush my teeth. I’m sick of people thinking I’m disgusting because I can’t seem to make myself shower. 

I’m sick of sucking at everything I try. I’m sick of being fat because I find comfort in junk food. 

I’m sick of my parents refusing me any kind of meds because they’re scared I’m gonna kill myself while on them. 

My boyfriend has been one of my only lifelines. I’m scared to lose him. I can’t lose him. I won’t be able to go on if I lose him. I don’t want to drive him away. 

Why couldn’t I have been normal? Why do I have to suffer through this? Why couldn’t I have been a normal teenager? 

This year has been the worst for my depression  and I’m sick of it. Idk what I did to deserve this.

I won’t kill myself. I’d never do that to my boyfriend. But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about taking a knife from my elbow to my wrist before. 

Everything is hopeless"
384,depression,I keep trying to describe what I feel like but it's really difficult. So have my most recent attempt,"It feels like I'm drowning. Like I'm far below the surface of the water and everything else is above me. I can see it, distantly, and I can faintly hear everything that's going on. But it's all far away, and not matter how hard I tried I couldn't swim up, so I let myself sink. 
.
I feel like I'm watching my life from the passenger seat of a car. I have no agency in what I do and I don't know why I do it. Because it doesn't feel like me. When I look at my hands they don't feel like me, no part of me does. I feel fake, and like I'm floating behind some stranger, just watching as they make all the decisions.
.
I feel hollow, and empty. I don't feel sad or upset or happy or like I want to cry. I'm just numb. I get anxious or think that everyone hates me but that's not a feeling that's fear. 
Everything seems hopeless. Nothing I do seems to have a point. I feel trapped in my life, in school, in my job. Like the walls are closing in from all directions. 
.
It's so hard to be honest about, anything. Even in therapy I feel like I have to uphold to a certain standard and that,  being honest about what I feel would just disappoint everyone, even if they're just there to help me.
.
I look at myself and all I can feel is disgust and distance. It doesn't seem like it's me but that doesn't make me hate it any less. And it feels like I'm disappointing everyone just by existing. Everyday when I wake up my first thought is to blame myself for still being alive. I don't want to die though. I want to be alive but I want to actually live, not follow someone I don't know. And walking, or hanging out with people, or eating well isn't going to change that. At this point, it feels like nothing will."
385,depression,Allies,"I wish I could kill anyone who says ""it gets better or The world will miss you once you’re gone. or  Committing suicide will never solve your problems, it will only make it worse for the people you decide to leave behind."" You don't know my FUCKING LIFE!"

389,depression,Should I kill myself or lose weight and live with loose skin (Genuinely serious),"I have been dealt a real shit hand at life and everyone uses me to dump their hardships on me because ""I'm the jolly fat man"" realistically I'm really good at hiding or not showing any emotion at all. Now a days I can't force myself to cry.

I got debt from being a student which I dropped out on because I wasn't mentally stable (mental stability is still shot) but it was school or homelessness and I had to get the loans...

Ya know all the shit we sad people go through whether its neglect, abuse, physical or emotional we're all a little broken.

So to the subject matter. I'm a big man built like a dwarf without a beard and if he was 6'3. Stocky, yet more fat than muscle now. Life's been a downward spiral ever since school and instead of hard drugs I choose food as a copping mechanism. Smart? Right? Well I started a gym pass got some motivation from a couple friends and I realized. I'm going to hate myself more than I do now because instead of being fat and disgusting I'm going to have loose ass skin and be the literal definition of a walking abomination. 

So the question is: do I kill myself save myself the debt I owe and all the pain of losing weight OR do I endure massive malice and headaches about financial despair hindered on the fact that I would never want to look at myself in a full body mirror again and be further ashamed of myself.

I'm thinking the ladder. There's a real high bridge in my city for trains probably one of the biggest in North America. Was thinking of going splat. Real comedic value kinda makes me think bugs bunny.

Thank ya kindly for the read

390,depression,Just feel like I'm drowning.,"Feel like I'm drowning , everything is just coming all at once. Family life just keeps getting worse , been unemployed for a couple months , girlfriends got depression and I don't know what to do , my autism doesn't help when it comes to understanding people never has. Feel like Atlas right now."
391,depression,Why am I so worried about the future?,"Hi,

Any external influences, such as the pandemic, trigger a huge amount of anxiety in me, that later turns into depression. 

Looking at my future, I see that many different things can go wrong. I later imagine myself living life that I didn't want to live. 

For example, I'm scared to do my master's for the following reasons:
- scared that I'm going to fail my classes
- scared that I won't like my major
- I'm afraid that nobody would want to hire me later on.

Why is that? Is it normal to think that way? What do I do to cope? 

I never failed a class in my life. I'm quite hard working. But I always get scared and then depressed. 

Before in my life, when faced with anxiety and stress, I'd be excited, happy etc. Today my mind and body responds to that with depression, isolation, and lack of energy. It is very overwhelming to think. 

If you have any way of knowing how to fix such issues, I'd be very thankful."
392,depression,Im tired of being alone. I just wished I die already,"No one ever remembers me, talks to me, or wants to do anything with me. I've struggled my whole life being an Aspie. I'm only 22 but I can't see myself living any longer. I work hard, I think I'm great with computer software and hardware, I try to do for others and be considerate but no one cares.  No matter how many ""friendships"" I have no one tries. When I want to hangout or do something they cancel or ignore me till they feel like replying. I feel so defective and I hate being alive."
393,depression,The weight of nothing is so heavy,"I am so focused on trying to get through each day. i dive into things that used to bring me happiness.  I try to focus my energy into those activities because at worst I will be partially engaged. At best I will be mostly engaged. And when im engaged i forget how i have nothing to live for, for a moment. Then I remember that its going to be the same shit tomorrow, the same shit the next day, on loop. And with each thing I create, I'm just trying to avoid the nothingness, the emptiness. But nothing is always there waiting for me when im done. And its heavy, and my back and neck are tired"
394,depression,UK How can I get help without being forcibly detained?,"UK, death of second parent 5 weeks ago, managing all legal paperwork and estate, dealing with legal bs from close family lying (with mental health issues) and who is now ignoring me making my life harder, in family home on my own, cared for second parent 18+hours a day for final two weeks of life, helpless as over £6k of their money + assets stolen by the dying's partner (police not interested as only dying person could report it apparently - really), having to live with the flash backs of their dying process, betrayal of their stealing lying partner, no one to turn to. I actually have no friends, house has curtains shut all day apart from second parent's room which I open and close daily.

I have ""just in case medication"" that was given for the later stages of the dying process ""just in case"" they were in pain, convulsions or sickness. (For the unitiated, this includes many vials of morphine and other toxic medication)

I do and don't have ideations of killing myself. More do not, than do. It would be terribly unprofessional and leave a mess behind, so I want to talk about stuff. 

I don't know how to go about getting help without being forcibly led to take a walk into a hospital and involutarily detained. GP surgery is phone call only thanks to COVID19.

How can I go about things without being detained against my will?"
395,depression,Thoughts,"I don't know how to start this really but I'm going to pretend what I type will help me and let myself express my thoughts. 

I just feel so lost and don't want to be here anymore even though there may be many people that appreciate who I am and are grateful for me being around and just trying to make others happy and laugh. But I only do this to make myself feel better. I get off making others happy because that's what counts. 

But my mind is trapped and I don't know what's happening. But everyone just seems so fake and even though I can be surrounded by many I know I'm lonely. That probably sounds basic. The thought of suicide comes to my brain but obviously I can't do that although I'm capable. It's the fact that those people that do really care I'm telling myself they don't and just put my mind with inner peace but I know I'm going to hurt others or put them in a fucked mental state like I have put myself in.

Seeing my friends being successful and happy and got someone by their side and having a social life. I'm just left in ignorance, people hating on me when I don't know the reason and when I ask, I end up isolated from misinterpreting. I just have this natural assumption everyone is against me but the only one against me is my insecurities. 

Usually I'm someone to start a conversation and I realise it's only me that always starts them and learnt no one really cares if they can't put in the effort to say something, ask how I'm doing, how has my life been ect, where I've been inactive on social media or whatever and find out there's no notification, no nothing. 

Maybe I'm just complaining, overthinking shit. I don't see myself in the future. I see myself failing in school, the motivation is just getting lower and even though I'm forced to get up and go to school I don't have the energy to do anything one I'm there. I just sit and don't move. I can't picture an image of an older self. I should just put my life to rest because living is just fucking up my head.

P.s. I know it's repetitive and there might be spelling errors but I just wanted to express what I was telling myself internally"
396,depression,I had thought I was doing better.,"I have made progress i know I have. But when someone you love says that they have not noticed any change is devastating to me. I asked because i was actually happy I was proud of myself these battles are near impossible to win. I had thought I was doing better. Now I feel like I've had the rug pulled out from under me. I had thought I was doing better i have been doing better and no one has noticed. Ive been doing everything to make myself mentally well, physically too 

AND now one has even noticed. What was the point then to try and be better? Its night and day the changes in me. I'm clean im taking care of myself im doing things around my home and im actually happy go lucky THE OLD ME how I used to be.

Nope. No change noticed. I'm going back to bed. Fuck this crap. I guess I am really invisible to everyone. And so ill thought of that any change for the better is looked down on as doing nothing. God what a kick in the gut."
397,depression,i’m a shitty person,"i don’t even know if this belongs in the subreddit but bare with me. my depression has worsen to the point of self harm these last couple of months and it’s all my fault. i’m a shitty person who hurts everyone around them. i feel as though there’s this darkness that surrounds me that i cannot get rid of. my mom loves me so much and it hurts her to see me like this but i can’t bring myself to even be around her sometimes. i feel like a burden on all of my friends because i’m so depressed i can’t even carry a conversation. i ruined my last relationship by being selfish and ultimately losing the love of my life. actually i’ve ruined every single relationship i’ve ever had. none have even lasted a year. i can’t figure out one thing i’m fucking good at. all i do is work, smoke, sleep and it’s so hard to pull yourself out of this when you know it’s all your fault. when you know that every thing negative you say about yourself is true. but whatever, it’s late. i’m drunk just shouting in the void i guess."

399,depression,i don’t have a will to live. anyone else?,"i’m 16 and i have no interests, hobbies, things that make me happy. the future scares me because i literally don’t have any ambition or passion and i’m going to have to choose a careeer path soon but i don’t even know how. i wish someone could just plan my life out and set it in front of me then i could just do it. has anyone else had this problem? i just feel like whenever i talk to other people with depression &amp; other depressive mental illnesses they all have interests and “dream jobs” and ambition.i have none, and it feels embarrassing to say."
400,depression,I don't know what to do anymore.,"I am 22.  I've been severely depressed off and on for four years, embarking each time on a long and difficult journey toward some concept of ""functioning,"" and each time, I find a mere few weeks of borrowed time before I find myself slipping back into the chasm of worthlessness.  This process has, yet again, ended in complete despair.  I recognize that I have the mental/physical capacity to act and accomplish, but I am, despite significant effort on my part, completely incapable of utilizing it.  I'm perpetually frozen in a cell of my own making, and every attempt I have made to escape has failed astronomically, and I end up back at square one.  I no longer think I will ever get past this.  I have beaten my head up against a brick wall for years now.  I see others' beautiful and/or hard-earned work and smile, then wish to sink into the floor and perhaps further into the ground, as I know that I will never create anything half as worthwhile.  How horrible does that thought process make me?  How twisted and selfish?  My inability to function in any way makes me a useless waste of a body.  My being unwell for so long has put a great deal of strain on those I love.  I have hurt people around me and wasted their time and their hope.  I don't wish to waste further energy - either my own or that of those I love."
401,depression,Help me. 22/M,"I want to kill myself, I can barely sleep at night.
My parents expect so much from me. But I just can't. I can't be the perfect son for them, can't study, can't run household errands for them, can't go to family gatherings when I am expected to be there by everyone.
My brain is so foggy and slow right now, all I want to do is be in bed all day, but still I can't sleep. I have exams in 3 months which I know I am definitely going to fail due to my depression and anxiety. What should I do? I feel like I am going to waste the rest of my life doing nothing. Absolutely nothing. Please. Somebody. Help. Me."
402,depression,My Anxiety.,"**Not sure why im posting this. Or posting it here but it helped tonight and I guess it feels like I'm opening up so here it goes.**

My anxiety is going to kill me. That is my thought now. I feel that the only way to keep it at bay is to tell it that. It is okay, you will do it, just not right now. Right now, it is okay, you do not want to die yet. But my head. Oh, my head is whispering those dark thoughts I cannot escape. It whispers almost like a feint echo in the back of my mind. This is not me trying to be poetic, that is how it feels. We all have our inner monologues, right? But this is different, its as if when I am talking to myself, there’s sort of parasite, a second me. The negative manifestations in my head speaking in parallel with everything else. I cannot get a break from it. Its as if its muted, when I speak to myself it is there, running in the back but I almost ignore. Well sorry, I do ignore it. IT IS MUTED. But I know what it wants to say. ‘Why are you still alive?’.

This is my anxiety. I must operate at two levels. I must mute my negative thoughts because they are so low, they are even beyond low. They are evil now. They are just killing me. It is eating me. I am exhausted mentally from it. And trying to explain it is so hard. But this is how I understand it now.

You know when you are taking an exam, or something with that level of mental strain, your head is going a hundred miles an hour, your speaking to yourself, reading the question, you process the words on the page and you search. This entire time your mind is racing but you hear the words you are speaking. 

That is my mind.

All day every day.

But I cannot hear it, not properly, not if I am choosing to not hear it. And this is where I may lose my explanation to people. But its running, like a tap, my mind is racing, and I have a thin layer of plaster over it, that when I ask myself ‘What am I thinking?’ it opens, it flushes out “kill yourself”. So, I close it, I shut it and tell myself ill never open it again. 

But I have done this, for so long, for every waking minute now of the last 4 years and I am tired, I am so unbelievably tired, I am so drained, my head is so full, yet so empty. Every day and I can’t explain it properly to the point where it makes sense. But something changed today.

It has gotten worse, for the last few weeks the sadness had dissipated. I was not sad; it was kind of nice. Yet I was numb to how I felt, yet my head was still buzzing, uncontrollably in the background. But today I woke up and the sadness was in my chest, that sounds so nonsensical to say, never mind write. But I woke up and my head was just fucked. But my heart, oh the feeling in my heart is unbearable. Its so new but I am suffering so much. 

I wrote these words on the 29/08/2020 at 00:24am. After I finished the previous paragraph, I sat, and I cried. I want to ring my friends, I want to be happy, but I do not want to be alive anymore. I do not want to die, but I really do not want to be alive anymore. I need to reach out for help. I need a break, but I cannot. I do not know if I deserve one. I do not know if I deserve to be alive. 

My heart hurts. I have not felt my heart hurt in about 4 years. And it hurts so much. I am so unbearably sad. I am not alone in my life, but I am so lonely. I am alone in my sadness, I have burdened my friends too much to call them now, to tell them how I really feel, I had some progression but I fell again and this time I have fallen deeper than I ever thought I would let myself fall. 

This is not a suicide note. This is not a call for pity. This is an outlet I have in this moment. It is an attempt of expression. 

I am lost and I am losing."
403,depression,"im trying my best at everything, so why couldnt i at least not be alone while doing it?","i try to study, help my friends, making them happy, try to keep everything together, just...why, at this point i thought at least i wouldnt be alone

i thought i'd have someone that gave me compliments and said he loved me and that he's proud of me and we could have dates and we'd play videogames and watch movies together while doing sleepovers, we'd have fun and i'd feel loved, and i'd do my best to make his life the happiest in wichever way i could...i'd have someone to hug and give kisses to...i'd have someone that cares how im doing, or even if im still alive or not...i wouldnt feel alone anymore...i'd have someone that wants to be with me, and likes me just for who i am

i always felt like i could do anything but that's the only thing i cant do...whatever i try i always get it wrong...maybe there's something wrong with me, but i dont know what or how to fix it...i know im not perfect and i have many things to figure out but why...im just asking to stop being alone, im just asking to be loved like everyone else is...why is that too much?...and why am i not enough?

even if i was at the top of whatever i decided to do in my life, i'd still wouldnt be enough for anyone...

i wish i knew what to do...i wish i was as good as everyone else, or as lucky as everyone else...

sometimes i dont know why am i still alive, i mean, its not like someone cares if i still am or not at this point...no one cares"
404,depression,After 2 years I tried to kill myself (ofcourse I couldn't). I just feel like a failure!!!,"I don't know if I feel like a failure because I cudnt finish myself or because I couldn't keep up myself away from all that thoughts that bothered me....or because I couldn't rationalise my decisions in my life...
It's just has to stop somewhere!"
405,depression,Does anybody hate living in all parts of the world,"Is it just me or?
I hate living everywhere i move to, even when going on holidays to other places, I hate it. I'm not rich, I don't care for money, but I'm not in the lowest class.
Back to the main point, I really hate every city/country I live in.
Places i was in range from Niger/ South Morocco to Spain to Kuwait to Canada. so basically almost all continents of the world. But everywhere I have been to i always seem to hate it but while living there, it makes me hate the city i used to be in even more than before. I can't just look past the flaws and I realised that no matter where I go in the future, I'll still hate it no matter what."
406,depression,"Depressed, about to be homeless and shunned by the system.","I'm a 20 year old male with severe depression and anxiety. I currently can't work or do anything really because of how bad it is. 
My mother recently gave me until the end of September to leave because she doesn't like me.    

So ontop of the regular depression and anhedonia I have this stress too.   

Here in the UK I've applied for council housing and given them the eviction letter and even a letter from my doctor explaining my mental health and what would happen if I was homeless.  

But they don't care, they've been messing me around for over a month now, even with the help of a charity that will speak to them for me, nothing is working. I'm entitled to a certain band of housing, but they refuse to give it to me and won't even give a reason.    

I'm so terrified of what's coming, I currently have to wait 2-4 weeks for a review of my situation, which could still come back as a no by at that point I will be homeless.   

I won't survive in shared accommodation or a hostel, if I have to share housing with other people I don't know I will end up in a really bad position depression wise and am scared of what that would lead to.

Sorry for this rant, I'm just scared and alone and the system put in place to help people like me is actively fucking me over."
407,depression,Wish I Could Make My Parents Forget Me,Imagine having the ability to make ur parents forget u; that’s only 1 of 2 things stopping me from dying. I’m gonna still kill myself; I hope to god they can move on after I die.
408,depression,I found out today that my estranged mother committed tax fraud...,"...which in turn means I'm ineligible for student aid to finish college (USA). I'm going to have to drop out. I've spent the last hour dictating personalized suicide notes to my friends and family, before scrolling through my phone looking for someone I could talk to, just to get out of my own head. I couldn't find anyone. I just don't know what to do."
409,depression,A vent from a suicidal 22yo girl,"I don't even know where to start. Its 1:30 am here in my country and I can't sleep. I think about a lot of things, especially how pathetic my life is. Tomorrow it will be another day when I will feel the same things no matter what I do: feeling lonely, feeling ugly, binge eating to kill the inner pain, vomiting what I ate, etc.
Some days I can't even step out of the bed. It hurts to know nobody cares. To never be the first choice and never be loved. I live with my parents, they are not bad but..they don't really care about my depression, anxiety and bulimia (all diagnosed). The rest? No friends or lover. I am really lonely irl and it hurts. I post nude pics on here hoping to find someone to talk to, even if I know people aren't really interested in me. I don't know what's wrong in me, why people avoid me and I haven't found a single person really interested in who I am, in what I have inside. It hurts so much to feel so... unwanted and unlovable. Worthless. If I die tomorrow nobody would care. I am not exaggerating, thats the truth. I was saying I post porn pics on here just to feel less lonely, but I don't look good so it's not a good method . My body looks like I am 70yo, especially my saggy boobs, because I had anorexia when I was a teen, then gained weight, lost it, started to suffer from bulimia, so my body had a huge amount of stress which makes it looks like I am 70yo. My face isn't pretty either. I was heavily bullied in the past for my looks and the memories still hurts. I was also outcasted in school. Sometimes I just feel so... touch starved. I am a normal girl and sometimes I just woild like to feel protected, loved, to be hugged tight. But I guess I can't have those thing. I must accept the fact I will attract only bored people who need 10 mins of entertainment. I can't explain how worthless I feel. I attempted suicide once but it didn't work. Now I am suicidal but I won't do that. Yes, I have a therapist and I take medications but nothing seems to work. Sorry for my english."

My dad died this year, we were close it was quite sudden 6 weeks from diagnoses to death from cancer.
All my siblings still have a parent left i dont and I hate them for it. They are grieving just as much as me but they have their mother to turn to and im alone.

427,depression,Still learning about depression and need some input,"I (25f) had been in a relationship with someone (27m) for almost a year, but I ended up breaking up with him back in April because I had felt very neglected and unloved and whenever I tried to communicate my needs, I felt like nothing changed. I still love him very much and have since learned that he's been severely depressed. We have been ""dating"" again I guess you could say for the last couple of months, though I am not currently very happy with the situation. I still love him very much and I want to be able to work through our problems and understand his depression better, but I feel confused about his feelings for me. He tells me he loves me and wants to be with me, but that he is scared. He doesn't think he can make me happy and he is afraid of me leaving him again, which is valid.

The main reason why I broke up with him before was due to the lack of communication. I couldn't rely on him to talk to me in between visits, and I felt like he didn't care what I was up to or think of me at all (out of sight, out of mind). He would come over almost every weekend, but during the week I would be lucky to just get a text ""goodnight"" before bed.

Anyway, with us spending time together again, I'm trying to be more understanding of his depression and not take his lack of communication personally, but I'm not sure how. I want to feel loved and appreciated too. Will I have to do all the reaching out/initiating if I want to talk to him? How will I know if I am bothering him? He tells me he wants to talk to me, but his actions make me confused because he doesn't try to talk to me. Any advice is appreciated. thank you.

Tldr; ex boyfriend is depressed and doesn't want treatment. He says he wants to be with me and still loves me, but is scared. He does not really talk to me in between seeing each other (maybe once every week or two weeks) and I don't know if I should take him for his word and keep trying or move on. I feel like I am bothering him when I reach out so I've been avoiding it (even deleted his number) and am waiting on him to actually show me he cares."
428,depression,Fuck,I’m in the hospital and I’ve never felt as suicidal as I do right now.
429,depression,Do I tell my dad I’m depressed,Hi. I’ve been severely depressed for about 5 months and have had depression over a year. I’m at the worse stage of my depression where I think of suicide a lot and just want to lay in bed and stare at a wall. I either feel nothing or am crying my eyes out. I have no motivation for anything. I see a therapist and am 2 weeks on an antidepressant (I know it takes time to work.) my parents are divorced so my mom knows about my depression. I’m a 20 year old college student. My dad is visiting me at my apartment today and my dad is my favorite person in the world. Im tired of acting like everything is okay. My dad is the type of person to not understand depression. Before in the past he has said when the topic of suicide has come up he thinks it’s selfish of people to commit. I feel like I’m lying to my dad when I tell him everything’s good at school. I don’t know how to tell him and if I even should. I wish I didn’t exist
430,depression,I don't know what to do,"I don't want people around me to read this post, so this is a throwaway account. I am dealing with depression and anxiety disorder for a bit more than a year now. I am using medication and it helps (I can sleep, don't cry 8 hours of day) but I don't get therapy anymore (for 2 months) because it started to get a bit over my budget. I was never confident about myself, my look or intelligence. But for me everything got worse when I found out my partner was lying to me about something we fought for years. The worst part was he was lying to me so easily and once I found out the truth I felt very bad about myself. I thought I was this stupid person and he thought he could make me believe so easily. We are still together but it hurt me a lot, I couldn't get back to normal, everything felt very bad and I wasn't even able to sleep for months. I can't say that what happened was the only reason but it was more like a trigger which proved every fear about myself right. We are together for 5 years now and I feel like I can't control my feelings anymore. Sometimes he says things that make me upset and I can't get over it, it goes for days. I don't like to fight but I just stay silent and mostly angry. The bad part is, I feel like I want something to hurt me at that times. It feels like it can relieve the pain and anger I have. This freaks me out, I have this fear that all of a sudden I can hurt myself like biking to middle of the road or cutting myself. Although I had thoughts about dying, I was never suicidal. I think I am still not but I don't know if I need a different treatment? I don't know how to deal with this. I'd appreciate any suggestions or experiences on similar things.  "
431,depression,I just want it to be less,"Been having depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts since the age of 8 (28 now) 
Tried to kill myself a few times, obviously didn't take. 

Sometime after years of therapy, I decided that I should just keep trying and what not, and was content for a good 2-3 years. 

Then I turned 26 and everything that I did to keep myself sane came crashing down and every few months things just got worst. 

I got a cat to help me with my anxiety and it worked in a way. 

But now, its been months of just dragging my feet. I just keep doing this and that. Plan and do small things to help me get to the next day, next week. 

I'm exhausted, just want to go back to content. I don't know if I can ever not be depressed, I just don't want it to be this deep."
432,depression,Why is access to a psychiatrist so difficult in the US?,"The irony is that I’m a doctor. 

I can prescribe myself the antidepressant that I want to try next but it’s frowned upon by my states medical board to do so. 

I could call my doctor friends and ask them to prescribe what I want but I don’t want to have to explain just how severe my depression is and that I have a plan to kill myself if my fifth attempt at taking antidepressants goes awry. Apparently I have pretty treatment resistant depression and I feel really pathetic that I can’t fix myself. 

So I called my psychiatrist (a mid level provider) who is a very nice lady but I know more than her so I feel like an ass sometimes. Anyways I found out today that she left the practice so now I have to establish with someone completely new and the earliest appointment is the middle of September. 

What if I kill myself before then? I wish I could convey the urgency of this appointment without sending up so many red flags that I get committed to a hospital for 72 hours and risk losing my job as a doctor. 

Your doctor thinks about killing herself too. I wish my patients who come in depressed and turn to me for answers understood that."
433,depression,Am I depressed?,"If someone has the time, it would mean so much if you read this. Sorry if its jumbled. I have barely been getting any sleep. Its 530 am right now, I slept 2 hours last night which feels like a lot. I don't know whats wrong with me. 

My earliest thoughts of sadness that wouldn't just go away happened when my first ""love"" dumped me when I was in middle school. I remember that I was incredibly sad for long period of time that most of my friends thought I should have felt better by then. 

I think high-school was a weird time. I did a lot of drugs. I did Molly, acid, synthetic RC acid, anything that would make me feel better/different. 

College felt like a turn around for a short while. I was out of my parents house and had a job at my favorite store. 

Then I snapped my arm. Its a long story but my bones broke through my skin and my arm will never fully heal, and a faulty plate was installed during surgery and is now broken inside my arm. Its been 4 years and it still hurts/is sensitive and numb on the area it broke. 

Right after this happened I connected with an old friend, and we hit things off well. She pulled me out of this hole I was spiraling down. At this point I was out of control with drugs. I was prescribed a ton of painkillers for my arm and doing whatever else I could get my hands on. 

I started to fall in love with this girl and we started to be a thing. We were hooking up for a month and a half and I was head over heels. She got me out of my shell and introduced me to college parties and all the stuff I was missing out on. 

Then I get a call from her while I'm at work. Someone in her family was in poor health so when she asked to call i thought it was regarding that. I prepared to comfort her. Next thing I know I'm on the ground in tears because she has just told me its over and she didn't want to talk about it. 

My mind snapped. I was hysterical. I told my manager I had to go home and I was in no state to work. 

About a week and a half later I was fired for ""low morale"", i was a lower level manager and had 0 write ups or infractions. My manager let a girl slide under the radar while drinking beer in an apple juice bottle on new years eve. She had done many other things but I thought that was the breaking point. 

I thought, let me get out of town for a weekend. I'll grab a friend, go camping and be nowhere near this girl I cant take my mind off of. Cue to the middle of the desert where there was hardly anyone in sight for miles. We find a visitors center and were there for hardly 10min. While waiting for my friend at the restroom, I hear my name called from behind. It was the girl who I was heart broken over. She gave me a hug and said she was out camping too(I saw on social media she had been here the week prior, who tf goes out of town to the same desert 2 weeks ina row???) I felt the odds were against me and the weekend became a paranoid nightmare. 

Here I was beaten down to a pulp, my arm started to get worse. One of the plates installed broke. I was put into a cast from my finger tips to my shoulder for 9 months. When it came off I had muscle atrophy in my elbow and wrist that still bothers me today. 

I was living on my own and going through college just trying to get by. I started secluding myself and I had always been a big video gamer but now I started BINGING games and getting high all the time. I couldn't do any of the physical activities I liked. I was just sitting at home doing school work and playing video games. 

Things continued like this. I got into coke and downers for a while and enjoyed them. 

My life seemed to be at a balance of i was in pain and felt like I lost all my friends and people I cared about, but I had enough mental bandaids to cover it up. My closest friends started disappearing. Then covid hit. 

I lost my new job. Riots were taking place on my street. Grocery stores for towns were closed. I was in a panic. 

I had to move back home. It became so hard, my mom and I dont get along and I was losing my sanity. I started buying Xanax and it helped me stay cool all day and not get into any arguments with her. 

Then I wake up one morning and can't move my arm. It was in so much fucking pain I was screaming. 2 days later I get an xray and its broken in multiple locations. I'm immediately told not to expect a full recovery. 

So this is where I am now. When my arm was healing I told myself I wouldn't be able to make it through another similar injury, and now I'm stuck in it. I can't do this anymore. The pain won't let me sleep. I'm losing weight and barely eating 1 meal a day. I weigh the same i did when I was 15. 

I'm in too much pain to hurt myself. I just don't want to be here anymore. The only thing that gives me any enjoyment is playing video games. And my mom makes fun of me and calls me a hermit. Idk what to do. Its like the game is the only thing keeping me alive but anytime I talk to my parents about it I'm speaking gibberish and they don't care. 

I dont even want to be happy, I just want the racing thoughts and regret and sadness to go away. 

I really hope someone reads this. I feel like I'm at a tipping point. The physical pain I'm in from my injuries is winning, I can't sleep and I want an end to my suffering.

Edit* A huge detail i just remembered is that I'm adopted. I found out when I was 8. It hurt me so much for some reason. Two years ago a girl on Instagram messaged me saying she is my sister. I then found out not only was I adopted, but I have 4 biological siblings. Who all grew up with my biological mom. Here's the kicker, im the middle child. I just can't seem to come to terms with the fact that I was the only one given up and I'm in the middle. All of my siblings seems so normal and have all these jokes and stuff with each other that just make me feel isolated. I've barely had one conversation with one of my brothers and he has no interest in being close with me. This weighs on my mind a lot. I fantasize about growing up with them and thinking things would have turned out different."

435,depression,Just wanted to talk to someone,"Hi to whoever is reading. 

Just feeling pretty lost and overwhelmed right now and in a bit of a mess. I’ve had a pretty good life, ups and downs of course, until this time last year when my best friend and love of my life started to struggle with being in a relationship and we decided to call it a day ... We did so much together and it was the best three years of my life - literally can’t give words to how amazing it was. 

Anyway, after that I was given the opportunity to relocate abroad for work, half way across the world. I packed up the stable life, car, job, my local bar, knowing where everything was, for a city I’d never visited. Within 2 months, I was gone. I arrived in my new city, new job, it was amazing. I still had my memories lingering but I was happy. My belongings arrived not long after, but then I started to realise that my job (same company) was not half as enjoyable as it was back home. The culture was very different, despite being similar countries. Some of my friends left and got new jobs, and then Covid hit. Within a week I was working from home, and personal projects were no longer a thing. I coped well to start with, but it’s been downhill since. I’ve lost all motivation to do anything, I’ve got so many personal things I want to accomplish, but I just can’t ... I started exercising and eating well, it lasted  two months then something hit my brain - I just stopped. I was then reached out to by 2 companies to change job, better money, but I just couldn’t make a decision. Very unlike me, who’d always made good decisions. My boss done everything they could to keep me, but to be honest I didn’t put up much of a fight - again, against my nature. I’m now just waking up each day and walking to my desk, asking myself what I’m doing ... I’m in my dream career, but there’s just no motivation there. 

I’ve been in a hole like this before, but it wasn’t this bad. And I spend my days and nights just wondering what to do with myself ... bored of crying myself to sleep only to have awful dreams"
436,depression,I'm about to lose my only friend.,"We're always fighting, and even when things go well, they never last long. It feels like the end is inevitable. I met them online, and we've been friends for around 10 months now, which is amazing on its own. However, I have severe social anxiety. I'm terrified to even voice chat with people. Once I lose them I don't think I'll be able to make another friend as close as them ever again."
437,depression,Suicidal Ideation resurging with a Vengeance after a very good couple of weeks!,"Okay, I have had a very strong in and off again relationship with depression this past year 

Dispite that, I have managed to make significant changes in my life.  Dropped serious weight and in much better fitness.  Though, not yet close to where I want to be.

Now, I had a few good weeks going up until my Birthday.  Had a small party the day before which was fun, but then the next day...

After roughly a two week period of feeling good, being playful and accepting myself. I crashed my both night. Couldn't sleep, my mind started racing...

All of it stems from those closest to me feel affect me in ways.  Like they show they care but it's like they have to act or show vs something they want to do?

I noticed a bunch of things over the years and this just all came flooding back.

Which leads me to my overall life...  If my job... My relationships..  my impact on this world after this time, this effort, to where the closest people see me as a project or consistently annoying or some fragile creature they have to coddle or nurture vs being authentic ?    Then what's he point of it all.

A rather large caveat.

I have strong feelings for one whom I feel a stronger connection with based on perspective and interests.  She doesn't reciprocate which I understand Intellectually.

Emotionally the more I tell myself to let go the more it's like I hold on and use her as fuel to change.  Regardless of the fact my subconscious is telling me in many ways ""No"".

Which leads me to the point I feel like they talk about me and make fun when I'm not around.  They or course tell me it's all untrue and in my head but they do that with others we all know. 

As a side note, I feel the party was an oh we did this for so and so and this person this summer so we need to make a token with him too or else he'll be butt hurt. 

Which leaves me with my own world, when I'm alone and a job that doesn't fullfill me, a body that I struggle with Because my looks are not that great.  And I see no way to change my Stars from this as it stands in a noticeable way.

One part wants proof another part wants to run.  Another just wants to find a way to let go and heal but it's hard when you question your main world isn't it?"
438,depression,Am I mentally ill or just depressed?,"* I don't talk to anyone. not a single person/family.
* After losing my job I spend most of the time on internet.
* I'm having suicidal thoughts from past month.
* I just don't care about anything or anyone anymore.
* I always feel like I'm falling into a dark pit.
* People try to talk to me and most of the time I just straight up ignore or don't reply.
* I always think how miserable I am and how I can't achieve anything or I'm a total waste and a burden.

439,depression,I’m worried that I’m about to have a depressive episode.,"I’ve had severe depression since I was 13/14 (I’m now 21), and have been seeing a psychologist regularly for 4yrs and psychiatrist for 3yrs. I’ve been on lexapro (initially 10mg) since 2018, I was on 20mg for a few months until March this year, but my psychiatrist lowered the dose to 15mg due to side effects. 20mg worked best mood-wise, but 15mg has been a bit better overall- I’m definitely slightly more depressed but it’s been very manageable until now. But I’m starting to feel that insidious weight in my chest - the type of depression that just starts suddenly and small, but slowly builds until I’m barely functional for days or weeks. I’m familiar with the pattern of my episodes, but I just don’t know how to stop them - and I can’t afford to have one right now. I’m actually doing well academically at uni, and I’ve got important stuff coming up over the next few weeks that I’m looking forward to. But I can’t ignore the feeling in my chest and the fact that I’m gravitating to my depression music more and more. I’m starting to randomly lose my enthusiasm for things I want to do or enjoy. I don’t want to spiral again."

441,depression,"darkness, my old friend","Argentina, day 161 of ""lockdown""

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a lonely guy, my parents were emotionally absent  so I've got all kind of problems, such as insecurity and anxiety. But in the last 20 days I've been like shit, I had several panic attacks, I spent hours on the bed just looking the ceiling and I just realize how depressed and messed up its to be alone.

 My ""friends"" they hang out and don't tell me that they will do it, they don't ask me how I am doing, I try to talk with them but they answer me after a few days as a ""polite"" gesture I suppose. I really don't blame them, I am really boring and an awkward person. I stopped talking to everyone because I really don't see the point.  And right now is kinda complicate to go out and meet new people, thanks covid. 

On the other hand my family is a mess, I don't talk with nobody, just an aunt that calls me once a month or so to check how am I doing, but honestly she doesn't really hear me, she is just being ""polite"", as my friends.  

At this point I really don't give a fuck about this, but I've got no motivation. I wake up, I play video games, I watch porn, and I go to bed again, that's all I do. The economy in this disgusting country is going to hell, I don't have a career, I don't have any ability. Everyday I say I will learn how to code and programate to leave this shithole but I just keep posposting it. Fuck me, and fuck this shitty world."
442,depression,"I don't have my own Therapist so I just do a ""Self Shrink thing"" but idk if It's gonna help me..","Whenever Im having depressive thoughts I just talk to myself in this app called ""Messenger"". I talk to myself alot irl so i made a second acc and talk about my problems there. 

I either vent out my frustrations and pour all my thoughts and feelings and even ask myself questions while answering them myself until i feel better.

It does make me feel calm and in control of my own mind again but idk if it's even healthy for me to keep on depending on myself or not even talking to anyone. I don't want to burden people with listening to all my problems Especially cuz i get problems all the time but i also want to hear people's advice and opinions."
443,depression,Am I suicidal or just sad?,"I don't see myself going through with suicide or making any sort of attempt to do so. However, I kinda hope I die &amp; I would definitely welcome death if it were to strike me anytime soon. Is that just depression/ sadness or does it class as sucidal thoughts?"
444,depression,Finally out of depression. Thanks to me.,"There are millions of people who die everyday in different parts of the world due to different reasons. Some die of diseases, while others of hunger and so on. 
I feel a lot better today. I have never felt this comfortable. 

God fucked them up right? There are kids who die on streets Everyday due to starvation but what he does? Nothing. He sees them dying. 

So if he's not bothered by the pain of a kid, who am I? A fucked up grown adult. What difference would my pain make to him when he himself kills millions everyday including kids. Accidents, starvation, diseases and what not. 

Sooo yeahhhh I feel so happy to realise that I'm destined to feel this pain. I'm here to feel pain. I'm happy as long as this world is balancing out. My pain = someone else's happiness. I'm so happy to realise that I'm in the list of people who have to suffer no matter how hard they try to get their shit in place. But I won't commit suicide because I wanna see my soul die each day, until my body dies. I wanna see the boundaries of god. How low he can stoop. How merciless could he be. I so wanna see that and feel a lot more pain and sorrow every fucking second. 

Fuck you God. ❤
Fuck us all. Fuck our entire Species. Fuck this universe. It's values. Fuck everything than can breathe and every other that can't. 
Also, 
Dear god, 
Enjoy partying with your favorites and giving them leaps of happiness while you fuck people like me up.
-Just another human in the universe you've fucked."
445,depression,I am afraid I am just lazy,"Depression has made me terribly lethargic. I don't take meds anymore so my family assumes I am doing better (can't blame them(. Thing is, I can do some things. Like, I can bring myself to go have a coffe early in the morning when there aren't many people at the coffeplace. Not everyday, but I can do that. I can also go out with a fwb once a week .I have no enthusiasm about these things, they seem like a chore to me, but I can do them.  But when it comes to going to the gym, it has been 3 months and I can't bring myself to walk 10 minutes away from my home to get registered. Due to social anxiety, it is easy to meet my fwb in the night, he picks me up with his car and so, people can't see me. But to go to the gym I have to walk on the people filled street. Also, staying at home (a year and a half now) without doing absolutely nothing is driving me crazy, but the thought of starting to work terrifies me. I am really not sad all the time like I used to be, I just don't really feel anything. I fear I am just a very lazy person because some things I can do, some I can't."
446,depression,I hate birthdays,"Its always the same I get my hopes up that something „magical“ would happen but in the end it’s like  any other day. I guess I’m to old to except something or to celebrate it. I spend the past birthdays with a bottle of whiskey and my messed up head.

I turned off the option that notifies people about my birthdays on social media years ago. I wanted to see who would actually remember and well nobody did. Like this year except for my two best friends. I don’t know why but I’ll get always get depressed. I guess I just except to much in the end it’s just a regular day. 

Also I’m kinda sad that my best gal pal, who is also my crush, forgot about it too...

I’ll most likely spend the day with my two best friends and do the same stuff we do everyday; getting stoned for like 3-4 hours and then I’m getting home and just go to bed which is depressing me but I don’t know what to do else.

“Happy” birthday to me, I guess."
447,depression,I wish life ends as soon as possible.,"I grew up as an introvert and shy guy. The school I went to didn't help me grow up in any sort of extra curricular activities, because no focus was given on anything else except studies. The place I lived didn't have much kids with whom I could hang out or play. Got bullied at school till 10th grade because I was thin. I was falsely accused of stealing money from someone's home, where I went to play with a friend of mine who was a year or two older than me. He stole it since he was their neighbour and knew where the money was kept. I was just 6. Beaten, stripped, I peed my pants *twice* and was about to be thrown out of my house by my father. My father has been a good father except for that incident. But it scarred me for life. I've grown up to be a loser, haven't achieved a thing. Low grades, hence no job. The girl I loved left me, don't know because of my toxicity or because I got boring for her and she found someone interesting. I just want this life to end. Although I am not brave enough to kill myself. Lumps are growing on my body, my mother is worried. But I am least bothered. I guess the people around me would be better off without me. Wish it ends soon."
448,depression,"Too tired to live, too tired to die","I lay there seriously wishing my body would just cease functioning, yet i will not go out of my way to complete the task, for several obvious reasons.

Yet i am the one that suffers most from this. I can't just stop and be still, my body suffers when i lay down to much and it suffers when i get up and have to interact with people.

It suffers when i exist in the silence and suffers when i exist in the noise.

There is no state that i know where suffering is not the given outcome"
449,depression,i don’t even know why i’m posting this,"i always wondered and dreamt of a timeline or dimension where my trauma never happened it’s worse that this doesn’t happen to many people or should, i feel embarrassed that these happened and i hate that my older sister yelled at me for blaming my parents for some particular ones when it’s their fault not mine. didn’t even anything wrong make these shit to happen. i wish everyday to wake up to that world  but i realise everytime how fucking hopeless it is.

corona is hitting my city pretty hard and makes my life worse than others, i don’t even have my own room to study or do classes for these have to wake up my sister for her room. i just want to be set free and it’s irritating being near them that i can’t be fucking alone at all. i have to be trapped with these people and it’s not covid fault when it only made it worse. government doesn’t even allow us to be out for long and i’m starting to lose motivation in online classes

i’m already planning to kill myself soon and i want to go out brutally, shows how much pain i have had to deal with in the last decade that was so unfair and unnecessary. it could have been prevented but people chose not to and i hope all these people feel the guilt, and i want to make sure i die in a hidden spot so don’t come back alive if anyone was to ever find me. i wish to be there and see those people cry while i laugh at them. there’s no hope for me"

452,depression,Why am I depressed?,"Hi redditors,

I found your community and thought I’d turn to you:

I’ll say it as it is: I an depressed but I don’t know why.

I have, a good stable job, stable finances, one year from finishing my studies, a girlfriend that loves me, stable parents.

What I don’t have: contentment, happiness, meaningful day.

I am basically feeling every single day that nothing matters. I’ve totally lost the spark. I can’t give my s.o. The love that she gives me, because it illogically doesn’t matter to me. 

I’ve tried therapy some years ago but I didn’t feel I got something out of it. 

I am severely starting to think I perhaps have some mental diagnosis? 

I think I’ve begun to socially isolate because I am rarely “up for doing anything” if the offer comes.

I am sure that someone here has been in a similar thought process and could share some thoughts about all of this.

Feel free to contact me in any way you want, if you want. English is not my first language and I live in the EU."
453,depression,“There’s no cure; but it’s treatable.”,"I work at an oncology outpatient center that gives chemotherapy treatments. A couple of my patients have told me “I’ll be doing this for the rest of my life...” Confused, I asked “How so??” 

They tell me “Well, there’s no cure for this cancer I have, but it’s treatable.” 

The other day it hit me. Depression is the exact same way. While there’s no “cure” for depression. It’s “treatable”. The only difference is that if I was struggling with cancer and knew it wasn’t treatable I could stop my meds/chemo and know it would end soon. With depression, you can stop your meds and still live in the same kind of hell."
454,depression,Done fighting,"Everyday somehow gets worse than the last, I really don’t think things are ever going to get better for me. My brain’s broken I’m stuck like this and I can’t get out. Every minute of my existence just reinforces the depression, it feels like quicksand and the more I struggle the deeper I sink. I genuinely don’t think I can keep going much longer there’s just nothing to look forward to, I’ve finally lost all hope. So yeah probably gonna hang myself someday soon here, I’ve tried a few times but I think I might really get this one to stick."

I have some really important exams on their way and I have to study but I can't bring myself to do so. I just want to lay in bed. I feel myself getting more and more depressed. I want to study, I want to but I can't. Even if I get up I just stare at my books with zero motivation. I procrastinate so much. My private tutor have tried to constant me but I just ignore them, and then I end up feeling guilty for not answering them. How am I suppose to tell them that I feel so down that I can't finish my work?! I will just dissapoint them but mostly I dissapont myself. I've been studying for so long I just feel burned out. What's the point anyways if I end up not passing in the end? 

I want to contact my therapist but I really feel like I'm annoying them. My last appointment was so shitty I got upset with them. I'm starting to feel like they don't help me or don't bother to do so, but I don't want to go through the whole process of finding a new one. 

Thank you for listening, I just wanted to get this off my chest."
460,depression,can’t help but feel like i’m invited to outings out of pity,"this may be anxiety and not depression, but i genuinely can’t tell anymore and i’m stupid as fuck, so please be nice to me.

my cousin’s invited me to her 21st birthday. the anxiety part of me doesn’t want me to go, but the steadily-growing-braver part of me wants to challenge myself with more and more outings, and to celebrate with my cousin. but another much bigger part of me thinks she’s just inviting me because she feels bad, or worse, because my aunt asks her to.

she’s incredibly smart, dedicated, pretty, and capable of anything she sets her mind to. i’m on the complete opposite side of the spectrum on all those accounts. i see the people she hangs out with, and i don’t even compare. she’s told me that she’s looked up to me since we were younger. i can’t believe that. i just don’t see how. what is there to look up to? i’ve been living at home since high school graduation in 2016 and i’ve only grown massively overweight and lazier than i’ve ever been! i’m a complete leech on my family! oooh, wow, sooo much to look up to!!

i don’t mean to be an asshole about it, but it’s just— everything and everyone around me feels like it lies. anytime something starts to feel right or good, i’m reminded that the people i’m with might not even want me here, or they asked me to tag along because they felt bad for how pathetic i’ve become. i don’t know how to trust in them when they say they enjoy my company.

TLDR: how can i trust people when they say they like hanging around me when i can’t stand hanging around me? if i hate myself this much, how can anyone else like me?"
461,depression,Really bad week,"I’ve felt nothing but sadness, anger, and inebriation this week. I’m 22 and don’t drink at all, but for whatever reason this week changed that.

I keep contemplating leaving my girlfriend because I don’t even fucking know if I’m capable of love anymore. I have 0 idea where my life is going, I hate my apartment, no motivation to do anything anymore. I really just don’t know what to do, I guess I’ll just coast along like this for the rest of my life because I’m to fucking scared to end it myself.

463,depression,It’s weird how some people can sense it...,"...even when they don’t know you and you’re wearing a face mask. Today I was on delivery 2 of 3 on a triple run for the pizza place I work at, when the customer asked if I was okay. She said that I seemed sad. Always trying to be a professional, I gave her a generic lie that so many of us tell each other: “I’m alright.” 

Truthfully, I haven’t been alright for about the past 18 years. I’m depressed, anxious, aimless, yet with a gut feeling that I’m not where I want to be in life. Like a terminator, I can’t off myself, but I’ve lost count of how many times I wished I could go to sleep and not wake up. Sometimes I feel like a zombie, a numb, empty husk, just continuing to feebly shuffle onward for no apparent reason. 

I rarely get to hang out with the very few friends I have, and although I won’t die a virgin, probably the biggest source of my depression is the fact that I’ve never managed to be in a romantic relationship of any sort. I think I’ve always dreamed of having a girlfriend, as far back as when I’d watch my pretty neighbor friend dance to the dream song in Sleeping Beauty. I know ladies are attracted to confidence, to ambition, but depression and anxiety leave me in very short supply of those qualities.

I really wanted to open up to a sympathetic ear, to connect with a fellow human being on a real level, but then she asked if she could pray for me... Look, I realize that she may have had good intentions, but whenever prayer is offered to someone who’s in pain, I have trouble trusting their intentions. It just feels like a salesperson trying to get their foot in the door, in this case, someone trying to sell Jesus. It feels like they’re trying to take advantage of someone in a vulnerable state."
464,depression,Really lonely. I'm trying so hard but things are getting worse.,"I always hate making posts like this because I don't want to come across as saying only my problems matter as opposed to all of you. I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I have diagnosed PTSD, severe Social Anxiety, Bi-Polar Depression, Major Depression, Seasonal Depression and ADHD. I have no friends because of my severe Social Anxiety. It's the hardest thing I deal with next to PTSD which stemmed from being raised by drug addicts who traumatized me from birth. 

To make matters worse I grew up in a very rich neighborhood and stood out like a sore thumb because of how poor I am. My twin brother and I were friends with the whole neighborhood when we were young. We were too ignorant to care what parents were saying about us, we just wanted to have fun. But when we got older we finally realized that they all judge us and didn't like us because we were poor and because of my parents. We lost a lot of friends because when we'd go over to their house we would be hungry all of the time because my parents spent most their money on drugs. We were taking away from my parents when we were young, but my parents got their act together and got us back. They love us, they're not bad people, they're just selfish and severely mentally ill with addiction. I grew up being beat by my drunk father and walking in on them smoking crack.  This happened my whole life up until a couple years ago. The beating has continued. 

I have a job, but this job is hard finding friends. Everyone's constantly on the phones. I also can't work 40 hours to get my own apartment because of my mental health illnesses. I'm trying to work to the point where I can do it. I've worked at over 10 jobs and done full time a few times before and I just can't do it yet. I am attending college and doing the best I can, I have straight A's, but right as I started attending college and being excited to hopefully make new friends, everything went online. I have been in therapy and psychiatric services since I was 11, and I'm 23 now, just to give people an idea. 

I haven't hung out with someone in over 2 years. I haven't had more than 1 friend previous to that for 7 years. I decided to face my fears because I thought that's how I would get better. I started live-streaming 7 years ago and over 7 years later 74,000 people have come through my channel. I even have two YouTube channels with a combined 300,000 views and still, no one stayed longer than a month or a year. Everyone leaves eventually and I can't handle it anymore. I have severe abandonment issues because of my drunk abusive father. It's hard for me when people leave my life. 

I try so hard. I'm doing school, working, taking care of my disabled mother and 3 animals. I've tried ending the pain so many times I'm incredibly lucky to be here, yet I get beaten down so bad by my social anxiety that I end up in a ditch like right now. 

My next door neighbor is a really cool girl who is somewhat of a friend. It feels nice to chat with her because I don't chat with anyone else face to face. But she just moved out today, and we plan to keep in touch, it still hurts. I said earlier I hate making posts like these and another reason is because I have no one to reach out to in my life about these problems. Everyone is too busy with their own problems and I totally get it. I just feel so alone. 

If it weren't for my kitties, my pup, my educational opportunity and desire to kick my mental health illnesses ass and get into politics to help people, I wouldn't be here. Also meeting people. I love meeting people. I crave meeting new people, hearing their stories, being a social animal like we all are. But I'm so scared of it and I've tried so many different therapies from so many different professionals and I've tried facing my fears and I've tried over 50 medications and yet here I am. I should be hanging out with people at my age but instead I'm playing YouTube videos constantly to pretend like I'm not utterly shut out from the rest of the world."
465,depression,I can't take life anymore and my remedy is to listen to sad music and think that life has no direction.,"I don't want to kill myself, let's start there. I know that at some point I will die and I'm aware. I want to live as well as possible and that is the problem, that I cannot live well. I have no money, I have'nt been able to work since the beginning of the quarantine, which in my country has already been 161 days. This situation is killing me and I don't know what to do.

Told her I need some time off. Don't have any close friends who actually care about me. I have a group with some close friends but as soon as I put something, they don't reply with much interest and seem like they don't really care what I post. Plus Im in my last year or college and I don't look like I'm gonna be going to any good career any time soon. My family thinks I'm sad all the time but I don't think I am.

468,depression,tiktok account that gives you reasons to keep living,"(not mine)
i found one of her videos on my for you page and i felt that it could help some people. ive only watched a couple but it doesnt seem to be the basic 'everyone will miss you' 'youll never get married/have kids'. its actually things that make you feel good ex: eating solid foods after only being able to eat soft foods after mouth surgery.

469,depression,What worked for me,"I have a genetic disposition for addiction and depression. Up until recently, I was constantly depressed. But I think I have figured out for myself, but it's definitely easier said than done. The first step is the hardest, but everything else follows easier than last step before.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1. Compliment yourself and boost yourself every day. When I say every day, I mean it. Happiness is a constant goal to pursue, it's not like an object that once you have it in your grasp you have it forever. Confidence will support you in this pursuit. The ego will hold you back. The difference between the two is significant...

Step 2. Remove any toxic people out of your life. Your environment will mould you. If you're surrounded by people beating you down or extremely dysfunctional relationships, press Ctrl+Alt+Dlt and remove them out of your life completely. Unless they're really good friends, you don't have to provide any explanation whatsoever.

Step 3. Exercise or do a hobby, and really dedicate yourself to it. Don't tell yourself that you *want* to do something. Tell yourself with the conviction that you *will do* something that is physically or mentally productive that will keep your mind off of things. For me, I really got into cooking, baking, guitar, anything that I felt would better myself that didn't involve substance abuse.

Step 4.  Love yourself for 100% for who you are. Selfishly, so that one day you can love someone unconditionally and selflessly. If I love 15% of myself and someone comes along and loves me at 40%, that's clearly more than I love myself. I'll be vulnerable to an even deeper depression if that person ever decides to leave me. Love all of yourself. The best and the worst.

Step 5. Feel enjoyment for the first time in years..."
470,depression,I'm a failure!!!!!,"I am currently work as a trainee for a quite famous animation company in my country (btw, I'm 23 and I come from Vietnam, so please excuse for my bad English skill). I've working for 2 months but I just keep make the same mistake, I didn't let that happen on purpose, I've tried to pay attention, double, even tripple checked for my projects but it seem i still made that mistake. I always feel worthless so  whenever I made a mistake, I'm very scared and embarrassed. My colleagues are so skilled so I always feel inferior to them, so I don't have any friends to share my feeling with. Every night before go to bed, I always look in the mirror and tell myself to be brave and everything's gonna be alright. It used to worked but now I can't fool myself like that anymore.

I don't know if anyone read my post and then, maybe, encourage me, but writing down my feelings like this calm me a little,  Thanks for anyone who spend time to read my post."
471,depression,I completely destroyed my life,"I completely destroyed my life. I an international student studying in UK, ( came from a middle income country), i did my foundation year here in UK (which is like a year before the actual uni starts) and i completely fucking failed in everything in my foundation year. i got some health issues here and some thing bad happened in my family back home which completely took my brain off of my studies.I want to do the foundation year again as i have no other choice, My visa was just for 9 months for the foundation year and I am pretty sure there is a 90% chance i will be rejected because pf failing ( almost 40-50% of the visas from my home country are already rejected ). My parents dont know i failed so badly, i just told them i messed up in one exam. I had everything a person could want to have successful life laid out infront of me, and i completely fucking failed. I have zero friends here (the one real friend i made here left me ) and i just want to f 'ing kill myself. I leave my room once in a week to get groceries and stay in my bed all day. I was so lucky to have this oppertunity to study abroad and messed it all up."
472,depression,Finally got help,"Bern struggling for some time now, 4 days ago decided to go to the doctors for help, finally got to talk to someone and get stuff off my chest, I'm now on antidepressants, I've stopped drinking, smoking, selfharm,  feeling weird on these antidepressants but hoping they will help."
473,depression,"Herbal for depression, insomnia, and anxiety??","I often feel depressed when I come home from work.  I feel, I'm being talked about by my co-workers.  I've always thought negatively about them.  My friend suggested taking kratom (mitragyna speciosa).  he said it can help calm the mind, relieve stress, and relax.  Has anyone ever tried it?"
474,depression,I thought I healed but it's back and it's more tiring than ever,"I have been battling this for way too long and for the past 4 months, I met someone things felt better, more alive.. I hate reasons to get up in the morning .
But as days go by I step back into reality a bit and realize I have just been burrying everything and it took a few days going wrong and me not being able to even talk to her to realize that's it's all wrong again.

I feel like I have absolutely no real purpose anymore no drive or will for anything, I used to be so much different than now.. I was a hyperactive curious person but all I can manage to do now is lay down and watch youtube all day, I don't create or craft things. I can't make music anymore, I can't even really think of planning anything in the future and it's hitting me again.

I had 3 breakdowns in one week this time


I tried telling her yesterday after she was finally here but she said that no it wasn't depression implying that I'm overreacting and I almost shut down completely, she kept apologizing but it was hard I felt so misuderstood.

I kept reassuring her and kept explaining how I felt only not to worry her into thinking she's losing my trust it anything.

But I feel lost and it's so tiring to feel like I'm back in that place.. I miss feeling alive"
475,depression,“She’s talking so she must be fine”,Does this happen to any of you? You talk about it and then people just pull out the quick responses and leave rather than if I don’t say anything and they think it’s serious now. I don’t know.. I feel like an attention seeker no matter what I do
476,depression,I wish someone would listen but I don't want pity,"I don't feel happy doing things I used to enjoy doing. My birthday is coming up soon and my bf is planning stuff out to do but I just can't seem to feel excited about it. I don't want him to feel like he wasted effort but the more he talks about it the worse I feel. Whenever I talk to him about how I feel it makes him feel bad and the conversation goes nowhere. I'm not blaming anyone for how I feel, I just want someone to listen but he just doesn't understand."
477,depression,How do I explain to someone what being depressed feels like?,"So
I’ve been diagnosed with Depression and GAD, and have been struggling with an ED for about three years

I’m really trying to figure out how to explain things like

-Why I sometimes feel bad and am scared to go to classes

-Why it’s hard for me to do simple things like clean my room, take a shower, do some work

-How even though I know it’s bad, SH is something I HAVE tried to stop doing, and am having a lot of trouble stopping 

-Sometimes its hard for me to be out in public when I’m feeling especially bad about myself, and  it’s not that I don’t want to see them, I just can’t stand the thought of being out in public where there’s lots of people

-I do love them, just sometimes it feels like I’m having trouble understanding they really love me

-I don’t always know what’s wrong, some days I’ll know and other days I’ll just be sad for what seems like no reason

It’s not like they’re trying to be rude or not understanding, it’s just whenever I explain things it makes it seem like they’re the problem and it’s really the opposite

I don’t know if this is a place for questions like this, but I figured it fit the topic and all of my friends are recovered so I can’t ask them"
478,depression,my friend cut me off when i continued to ask her for a place to stay,"no one makes time for me i just want a relationship with someone, i keep getting ghosted by everyone. being alone sucks ass. my unrequited love/crush ghosted me and im still trying to heal from that. i sometimes feel like whenever things start looking up for me they crash down and its back to the abyss of my mind where my demons feed on me."
479,depression,Politics is making me depressed,"As if all the things including staying at home, my insecurities, the news of this year, having an annoying-ass family, and it being an election year is just killing me every day. 

But the thing that kills me is politics. It broke my metaphorical camel's back I could have left it alone, but it being an election year just drew me in and now I'm dealing with messages of arguments and other BS. But only that, I hate the candidates, I hate the voters, and I hate everything about it. I hate politics. 

I just want someone who could fix all these problems and go back to life that's even better. It sucks feeling alone, it sucks fighting, I just want this stupid year to go away and be a dream, but it's not and it sucks I keep waking to this nightmare."
480,depression,Pure love how People bully you when you have no friends,"Because if nobody loves you, there must be a Reason, Right? It's not just that I'm depressed and cbf talking to people :))

Fuck that, I'm gonna love myself anyway

Amirite guys"
482,depression,It feels like nothing matters,"Since I can remember, I've had severe depression and anxiety (stemming from a childhood of abuse, yay), which has caused me to go through my entire life never having a friend, job or more despite trying my hardest. I'm currently 27 years old, which is pathetic to never have had a job, I know. Something about hiring a 20+ year-old with zero experience tends to make it impossible despite getting various certs.

I'm at that point, and I have been for a long time now, where nothing I do matters. Like, I know I'm going to die whether it's tonight, tomorrow, or 10 years from now. I just don't see the point trying anymore when all it does it lead to a day full of sadness and depression.

I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing brings me joy."
483,depression,"Is this depression again? Long post, i need advice","I am not sure what is going on with me. 

I've had a couple of long depressive episodes between ages 13-17, and they were pretty bad. I'd often cry or feel like crying, i genuinely thought nobody liked my company and all that. My self-esteem was very low, i had little desire to study, hang out with people or do my hobbies and i struggled with self-harm and suicidal thoughts. In summer last year, after zoloft treatment, i felt fine and it seemed my depression was in the past. 

I started struggling again in winter. My first semester at uni was exhausting, i stopped doing anything besides studying and basic self- and house-cleaning every now and then because i had no time and energy for that. The holidays felt like nothing and i drank almost every day. When the new semester started, it was just as bad. I would often complain of hating the university, it became very hard to make myself do my homework on the weekends, i remember howling out loud out of exhaustion and sadness. The pandemic made me stay at home, i went out maybe once a week or two and i became afraid of the outside world. I lost a couple of friends because i had no desire to talk. My only hope was something i'd planned long ago, and the plan had to be cancelled. This made me feel hopeless like never before. 

In summer i've felt so strange. Whenever i am around people, i do not feel so bad, i can communicate and enjoy my time, but it always feels unreal, like i am in a movie. I remember going on a trip with my friends, i was laughing all the time because my emotions seemed dulled down and it all seemed so unreal, i dont really understand why, but i could only laugh. We went to my favourite place to be, it has always inspired me and made me feel better even at my worst, but this time i felt nothing. 

So, i feel kind of numb. My appetite has increased (not sure if it's related to the subject though) and i am struggling with self-esteem. I've asked my partner to take a break from our relationship, and i still feel nothing. I know something's wrong, but it seems so different from my experience with depression before. Also, i feel like i am able to control it? For instance, when i feel the urge to harm myself, i can tell myself it's not worth it to have scars afterwards, to explain them to my parents and friends, etc. I have not cried in summer except for a few very stressful days.

Do you think it is worth it to see a professional in my case? I don't want to spend money if i am going to be told it's boredom and/or i just need to give myself a rest."
484,depression,Intense intelligence dysphoria,"For the last several months, I’ve had depression accompanied by intense dysphoria related to my intelligence. 

At first, the culprit was my college grades — despite trying very hard to get A’s, I’d get B’s in classes over and over again, and that was incredibly dehumanizing. Now, since I’m applying for software engineering internships, the main culprit is my performance in the online coding assessments that companies send me. Just yesterday and today, I failed two. One of them claimed my coding and problem-solving abilities were “poor,” despite the fact that I’ve been coding for several years. I seem utterly unable to learn what is required to do well in those assessments. 

A Facebook recruiter reached out to me recently, and so I may have an interview with them in the next months. I’m almost certain I’m going to fail it, and when I do, that will be incredibly depressing. It’s hard to imagine anything worse. 

Every single day I feel like the fact that I’m dumb measurably makes my life worse; every single day I try to do something that fails for reasons related to my low intellect. It’s extremely emotionally straining to have to go through life with all of this, especially knowing that my intelligence isn’t something I can change by getting a plastic surgery or something. 

Does anyone else here have similar intelligence dysphoria? I wonder why I do, such thing doesn’t seem common — I’ve certainly never heard of anyone feeling this to the degree that I do. Also, what could I possibly do about this? It seems like an unsolvable problem."
485,depression,My sister treats my suicidal depression and her friend’s suicidal depression completely differently.,"Here’s the kicker: she’s a mental health nurse. 

When I’m suicidal, I do everything possible to push people away (except actually physically pushing anyone (okay there was one time...)). This usually means telling people to fuck off, that I hate them, etc. 

My sister was the one watching me right after my suicide attempt, so she got the full force of my anger. Afterwards, she refused to talk to me, and the day after my attempt she even told me to fuck off if I was going to be moody and left me to walk 1 mile home by myself. 

Her friend, on the other hand, loves to be around people when she’s suicidal. She’ll talk on the phone with them for 12 hours, or go and cuddle them on a sofa somewhere and just talk everything out. 

Basically; her friend let’s people in, while I lock people out. 

Her friend called her the other night (whilst my sister was staying at home) and said she was suicidal. My sister stayed on the phone to her all night, and then in the morning drove 100 miles to support her in person. 

I know this is stupid thing to be upset about, but it just feels like she doesn’t care about me as much, if she’s willing to do everything for her friend but nothing for me. 

Her friend deserves the support, and I’m glad she has someone to lean on. I’m just a jealous asshole I guess lol."
486,depression,I missed four days of my online classes.,"I feel lethargic and depressed. I always overslept, avoid my responsibilities, and i don’t know why. I had a nasty cough and nasal congestion, and i feel very low and cannot keep up on my classes. Idk why. I feel so much guilt."
487,depression,Anyone else REALLY hate showering?,"I hate having to take off my clothes, how loud the shower running is. Then you're cold, only to get into the shower and have the shock of being either too hot or too cold. The you just STAND THERE and apply various soaps in a particular order until your arms are tired. And it's just so damn loud. Then after 10 minutes it's finally over. So you turn it off and it's so cold again. Your arms are already tired from apply soap and now you have to dry yourself? How do people do this every day? Then get dressed but all your clothes are sticky and your face is flushed.

It's all so over stimulating I hate it so much. People say how gross they feel not showering every day but I can barely shower once a week. I skipped one week and when I got out of the shower last time I had a giant dreadlock knotted in my hair that I had to cut out. 

I really hate showering. I never feel better afterwards."
488,depression,Today I feel very depressed and I will pop a xanny for the first time.,"Whenever I sleep bad, I feel extremely depressed. Today is one of those days. I just cried a bit a few minutes ago. Had to think about the beauty of life and how cruel mine is.

I never took medication before but I plan to pop a xanax in the evening. It is actually called Alprazolam 0,5 mg where I live. I am bit afraid to be honest since it's my first time and I heard some people get freaked out or get seizures. I just want to feel numb for a few hours.

Update 1: 22:11 GMT, I just popped half of the pill, so I only took 0,25 mg of Alprazolam.
I actually didn't even feel depressed before taking it. My mood was chill and I felt okay, but I took it anyway just to see how it is.
Will update if I survive... If I don't, I wish you guys the best. Hope you guys find the beauty of life, love and companionship.
Don't be me who threw everything away and has only pity left for himself"
489,depression,This is how depressed I am,I don’t want to waste anyone else’s time talking about what’s happening in my head and my heart.  I’m not worthy of your attention or concern. I’m just going to sit here and exist until I can’t bare it any longer.
490,depression,From depressed person to successful depressed person,"Anyone else find that success is irrelevant? Kind of hoped being successful in career, women, etc. would make me happy. I have a nice (insert belonging here) now. Women want me now. I have friends now. My career is successful. And yet I still feel complete apathy and a general longing to not exist. 

I kind of just hope maybe something will click? I just need a dog? Maybe a steady girlfriend? It's hard to keep checking off the checklist and not see an end to it."
491,depression,I don't want to live.,"Hi everyone,

I lost any motivation to live. My dreams are ruined. Reasons to pursue passions shattered. My heart is broken. My life purpose is gone.

I've been playing sports everyday for ten years, including playing pro for two years. Last year, I've got injured. I cannot play anymore without a surgery that would take a year for me to come back to playing. I lost a lot of motivation to sports, and believed it's for the best to stop. 

I've changed my plans to pursue my master's degree on the west coast. Everything was going wonderful. I've taken tests and got accepted to a few schools. I also met a wonderful girl, who supported me throughout the process. I quickly fell in love, she was my shorty. She was my best friend for months. 

Anyways, the pandemic happened. I was stuck alone at my apartment and couldn't hangout with my girlfriend. Everything was going okay but my parents lost their job due to the pandemic. Going to the schools I wanted to go wasn't an option anymore. It was too financially demanding, despite scholarships that I've got. I decided to pursue my master's at a state school in a completely different major that I wasn't passionate about but would be close to my girlfriend's school. 

I've got a bit depressed. I asked my girlfriend for a bit more attention, as I noticed she is pulling away. Someone who was calling me ten times a day, now barely had time to call me once a week. It was a really sad time. The person who a few months earlier told me she will never leave me, was pulling away. She ended up leaving me, saying that she can't handle a relationship. 

Today, I'm back at home. Far away from my ex. Far away from the west coast, where I've spent my last 5 years. Yet, close to my family and closest friends. Everything here seems to be grey, colorless, lifeless. I dropped out of my school on the west coast and decided to study Master's in Data Science at a decent local university. I'm not passionate about it at all. It would give me a decent job though. 

I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea whether going back home was a good decision. I have no clue if my ex, who was so in love with me, will ever come back. I do know that I love her. I miss west coast everyday. But I have no one there. My mind is telling me that due to what's happening, it's better to stay at home, and study something that is going to give me a decent job. My heart is telling me to do the other thing. Plus I'm sleeping at home with my parents for the first time in five years. 

All my plans were ruined by the pandemic. I've lost my purpose of live. I've lost hope that there is a true love. And I've lost motivation not only to do things but simply to breathe. I have no clue what to do. I just wished I wasn't alive. I know that I'm 22 but I'm hopeless that things will get better."
492,depression,no,i need help
493,depression,The covid situation brought us into money problems.,"My mom lost her job. My dad has to work 12 hours a day really hard just to barely make money. I struggle with school and doing an job at the same time. We barely go through the month and my dad can lose his job every moment because they could get bankrupt. If this would happen we can't pay our rent. This whole stress is overwhelming me and exhausting. I needed to just tell this someone. This life doesn't seem enjoyable anymore. My parents couldn't go under the stress anymore and started drinking which is bringing us into more problems.

Edit: i use a throwaway account because I don't want that my friends see my post"
495,depression,My Dad doesn't take my Depressin and Anxiety seriously... at all,"Last year I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and ever since then I thought my dad and mom (especially dad) would finally take my mental health a little bit more seriously. Guess what.. My dad didn't, my mom tried her best and still is trying her best to help me through this, but she has mental health issues herself… She has a substance abuse problem because she’s most likely depressed although her and my father refuse to go get help:( (Btw they’re divorced)

Anyway over the span of many months as my mental health dwindles, mostly due to some traumatic situations that happened in the past. I would sometimes try to confront my dad and try to explain to him how serious depression AND anxiety is… majority of the time he would disregard the fact that i have depression he just says Anxiety ain’t THIS and Stop it you can control anxiety THAT. He told me that I can control it and that it’s as easy as 1 2 3! NO ITS NOTTTT! 

Anyway I do this so much to the point I might as well give up but i don’t, because i need him to take my mental health seriously. He’s quick to send me to the doctor’s for ANYTHING that’s PHYSICAL but as long as it’s mentally he’s not that concerned about it… even when he was slightly concerned about me, he usually isn’t concerned or caring for long. 

Yesterday i got yelled at for crying and telling him that i may have PTSD from my past traumatic events… he called PTSD “PSD” *.*

Also while I was crying he kept on yelling ""stop crying!"" And I would ask ""Why should I stop crying?"" He literally had no explanation.

After that “conversation” (yes he called yelling at me while i was crying and mentally in pain a “conversation ”)

After that i genuinely wanted to kms but i grabbed a butter “k” and instead took my pain and aggression out on a nearby paper plate instead of myself.

I love my father, I really do and I'm very grateful that he is my dad because he isn't always bad he provides so much for me.

tbh he wasn't always like this… but I hope he changes soon for the better because I can't change if he doesn't:("

The longer we talk the more I start to figure out that she’s got a cage of negativity inside her that she keeps vaulted and on the outside she pretends to be happy. Found out she feels sooo alone, she doesn’t know her worth, she cuts and she spends hours thinking how no one would care if she died I just need help.

I’m about 6 beers and 5 shots of henessey in... wanting to finish the whole bottle. Alone in the dark in my room. I should be out with a special girl but she’s been ditching me for the past months, and it happened again. I feel so bad for whoever had to deal with me but it’s better I’m no part of their lives, like I’m just a waste. I’m crying inside. I can’t stop. I’m such a fool"
499,depression,Striving for that light,"About 2 months ago, the girl I thought was my forever broke up with me. I would be lying if I say I didn’t see it coming, the phone calls were shorter, she seemed more annoyed with me and I could feel myself not being a good boyfriend. I could blame the pandemic as we lived apart but I should have made more of a effort in making it through this. Since then I’ve never felt more alone, I love my family but we’ve never been great at talking about these subjects. 
 
The friends I have are busy, they have families and their own lives to worry about. So that leaves just work where I get my human interactions, I’m known as the funny guy so everyday it’s like I have to put on a show and make people laugh, if I show any sign of struggling it’s “what’s wrong with you?” Or “you’re no fun today” and I can’t just sit with these feelings. 

Life has become this revolving door of mediocrity. Wake, work, up till 5am and wake 1 hour before work and start all over again. The days bleed into one another, the breakdowns occur frequently. I try to bury it with buying shit I don’t need, even picked up running but instead of improving my body and mindset, it feels as though it’s doing the opposite. I’m not happy with who I’ve become, as a kid my parents would tell me I’ll do big things when I get older and I feel as though I let them down. 

I deleted my Instagram cause who’s going to notice, maybe delete everything else cause I have nothing to offer anyway. I don’t know what to do, I feel lost, I don’t want to do this anymore. How do I feel good again?"
500,depression,I´m fucking low if you are too HMU we can help each other,"&amp;#x200B;

I´m Gil and I´m Mexican. I´m struggling with hard drugs addiction, I need friends to help each other and move forward.

I love playing guitar and writting hip hop- rap and rock songs, I like drama and horror films.

I´m a good listene, maybe I´m a junkie but I just want to give some advices to people who need it. Hope you´re having a nice day &lt;3"
501,depression,Im tired of being used and then left,Everyone i knew and was friends with used me as i would listen to thwm wyen they needed someone and always try to help them. But when i need them they never helped just got pissy at me and argue andthen leave my life.  And when i get close to girls they all say i wish i had someone like me but when i ask them  they reply like ew no i dont want to date u they want my love loyalty and caringNess but not me as im seen as boring because i dont like going out im not sexual and i dont go out to drink  go to partys. As i feel safe and comfortable at home playing games.  I only showed the real me to only one person my recent ex but it took years to get on but it didnt last long.  I hate my happiness is temporary and isbt important to most people.  I have no friends no love life im not wanted in anyones life unless they want something.
502,depression,i’m seeing a lot of people out and about and smiling now that covid rules are more lax,"and many of my friends are telling me that going out more is going to make me happier and less depressed. i disagree completely. when they say “hell is other people” i truly feel that; i’ve been conditioned to enjoy digital connections and experiences with people but going outside and viewing humanity laughing and smiling as if nothing bad ever goes on makes me nauseated. i *like* quarantine, there i said it. every once in a while i enjoy seeing my few close friends or my immediate family, but most other people are of no interest to me. it just all seems pointless. quarantine me forever — i’ve had some downward moments but tbh i’m an extreme introvert and being alone and having peace of mind has actually helped me manage my anxiety and depression quite a bit."
503,depression,"i'm almost done, need a peaceful way to go","i lost my job not too long ago but my family doesn't know, so i'm just waiting until i run out of money. my uncle died from covid and he used to always ask about me and i never called and i feel like a piece of shit. i just can't take it anymore. i tried to kill myself a long time ago in a gruesome way and i have been traumatized with that experience and could never get/afford the right help for it. i've tried to get help since then and it's never worked out. i just need a good way out before i jump in front of a train or something. anything to set me over now i just need the smallest reason i don't care. please. i know i'm not the only one who feels they're screaming into a void that doesn't listen anymore. i'll tell you i severely injured myself and barely walked away just to show you my fucked up depression credentials at least so you know i know what it's like. feel like a drop in an ocean of untreated mental health just so insignificant and helpless. i just want to die i haven't showered or brushed my teeth in months i'm sooo fucking ready. just somebody tell me the best way to end it with out hurting anyone else. i'm teetering on caring whether or not i do. i've thought about writing an apology note and buying bleach and cleaning supplies to drop off at the train station. i don't know. there's no real good way to go clean is there? pills and alcohol? wrists? everything i google says it's not a sure thing and i don't know if it's true or not. i'm begging for a way out."
504,depression,How do I address my parents about this situation,I just failed a class that I spent all summer on and I’m sure my parents would be disappointed and flame me about it. I just don’t know how to correctly tell them and have them address the current situation without getting too mad.
505,depression,I wished people stopped thinking depression looked the same for everyone,"I had someone tell me ""youre not really depressed because you go to school, have a job work out etc"" but like i can do all of those things and STILL wanna die. just because i do things doesnt mean my brain isnt constantly yelling at me. i can get As and still get panic attacks before class. i literally cant sleep at night because the urge to kms is so strong. 

depression is different for everyone and i wished people understood that. its not always not doing anything and having no motivation. ive been there before too. where i would only shower once a week and and i spent days laying in bed. but honestly, i have never wanted to end it more than i do right now and people seem to think im put together when really, the only reason why i dont kms now is because i dont wanna create trouble for my family/hurt people.  when i was suicidal in the past, the thought of death used to scare me. now, im more upset that i cant just do it because of of how it would affect others.  i dont even talk to people about my depression because i dont like being pitied or want people to feel bad for me, but not being taken seriously kinda sucks lmaoooo"
506,depression,The only time where I felt I had control over my life...,Was when I tried to commit suicide.
507,depression,Therapy today.,I'm going to my first therapy session today and I don't know what to expect. I'm excited and nervous but I hope it helps me.
508,depression,No sex...AT ALL!,"I've been married for nearly 36 years. I still love her dearly. She is my one true love. But, with each passing year, her interest in sex has gotten less and less. Always an excuse, my head hurts, my legs hurt, I'm tired, etc. I'm not insensitive but, this has gotten to ridiculous levels! We made love about a month ago and, I had to convince her to do it. CONVINCE HER? In the past all I've ever had to do was, kiss her neck a few times and, she was wet, willing and ready! Now, I end up jerking off if I'm lucky enough to be alone long enough to do so. WHY DOESN'T SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO MAKE LOVE ANYMORE? I'm sorry, I know this sounds petty but, there are some days when, the discussion just isn't enough. The contact isn't a whole lot anymore. I remember when, all she had to do was see me naked and she wanted to grab &amp; stroke me until we did it. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't keep this up. The daily, boring, conversation would be charming and witty if only she would want to make love now and then. I do not cheat or, even think about fooling around. I know she loves me. We've had that conversation a million times. I get the, ""it's not you, it's me"" speech. I have fantasies about making it with men, I'm so wound up! I really don't know how to deal with the urges if, she won't or can't. I feel like, doing some harm to myself. If it weren't for my kids...anyway, thanks for listening to me whine. Hope your all staying well."
509,depression,I have no motivation,"All day everyday I put on a fake smile. People see me as the happy guy because I’m energetic and like making people smile. I’m everyone’s therapist and I’m told I give good advice yet I can’t seem to follow what I say. I started streaming on Twitch recently and that has been the only thing giving me temporary happiness. After that, I have nothing and nobody. I’m never asked how I’m feeling. Whenever I bring up to someone that I’m sad I tend to get a response of “lol same.” I have this deep pain in my chest that never goes away. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore, I’m not motivated to keep going anymore and I don’t know what to do."
510,depression,Can’t see how things get better,"Today has been a real hard one for me. Just feel like it’s been a real culmination of all the stress and anxiety I’ve had over everything that’s happened over the past five months. I just feel that everything is a real dumpster fire and I can’t see how it gets better. It really doesn’t help that I tried to reach out to a friend and they’re deliberately avoiding the subject, which makes me feel massively rejected. I’ve spent the last several hours contemplating hurting myself because things are just going to keep getting worse."
511,depression,"For the first time since I can remember, I'm feeling optimistic.","I have my learner's permit, and my behind the wheel driving test is scheduled for two weeks from now. I have a working car, on Monday I start the second semester at a University (online but ah well), I'm the first person in my family to do this. In October, I'm going to take an exam for a certification that will award me a job where I can earn more than minimum wage for the first time in my life. Once I get my DL, then I'll be able to do freelance work for my career field that my degree is in, too. It seems like very soon, almost every problem I have is going to disappate. Then I can work on the handful of ones that persist. I was told that whenever I achieved these things, I would still be depressed, but I'm not. I'm looking towards the future and I actually see a positive outcome."
512,depression,Family currently is one of the sources of my anxiety and I feel really guilty for that.,"Hey, guys! Let me try to add a quick background about my family.

Basically, it resumes to an abusive dad (60 y) (who tries not to look so abusive) and my mom (64 y) who is a great person. We live in different cities, but not so far. My parents live close to my mom's family, that is great, supportive and loving, but have a serious problem: They are really dramatic!

They overreact to everything and they have a tendency for depression and anxiety (oh, look from who I got those shitty dna lol), always talking about feeling sick, pains, diseases, and create a huge drama about every little thing, what makes me feel even worse once I got a childhood trauma by being present during my mom's panic attacks.

And that drama gets really worse when me and my sister are the only children of the family (yes, no other cousins to worry about)

Last 10 months have been quite hard to me, my grandad passed away, both my parents got covid and my dad almost died because of that (both are ok now) and all those things really made my anxiety and depression really worse.  
Before that I felt anxious sometimes and quite unmotivated (plus other symptoms of depression), but never really looked for professional help.

Last month I finally went to see a psychiatrist and started the treatment. I'm feeling a little better, but I know I need to stay still and keep up with the treatment to start feeling great again.

The point is, as we live in different cities, I go to visit them(parents &amp; mom's family) often and that ""event"" almost always makes me anxious because of all the drama, fights, etc...

It's been about 3 months since I was there, but my parents are at the same city I live for health treatment after covid and want me to go with them to their city to stay there for a while and I DON'T WANT TO GO. I know it may look silly an adult (30 y) person is worried about family's opinions, but I know they will dramatize that decision as well.

I feel guilty because I don't feel well with the people I love the most on this planet, I feel guilty for not being able to take care of them as my parents get older.  
I don't know whether I am right for being a bit far from my family to try to take care of myself or I am being selfish (because that's how they make me feel sometimes).

Should I force myself into that situation? should I be still and once for all decide my things on my own instead of always listening to my family's opinions?

I am sorry for the long post, but I'm feeling quite lost about it and it would be good to listen to some different opinions about it.

Thank you!"
513,depression,How do I tell my mother?,"Hi, I am 19 years old and although I haven’t been clinically diagnosed, I have been feeling depressed for more than 2 years now. I self harm sometimes and even think about suicide a-lot. But as I am highly functional and in a good college and everything my parents don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with me. They think im just being “moody” and “spoilt”. Lately, living has been so tiring for me, I just push myself from day to day to live, to keep some hope alive. I get anxious and stressed out on the smallest of things and have breakdowns. I get a-lot of nightmares and I am sad all the time. It’s getting really hard for me to go on and be functional. I need help. I need therapy. But I have no idea how to tell my mother. I don’t want her to feel hurt but I really need therapy/medication now. Someone Please tell me how to ask for help without worrying her."
514,depression,"It’s been a while, so update.","Everything is pretty much the same. Applied for a job almost 4 months ago, got it, worked it for all of three weeks before home life got too exhausting and I just had to quit. And I enjoyed my job, but coming home and having to do so much, having to deal with everyone else’s problems, having to deal with my own problems is just too much. 

I was finally able to get my niece on the right track; she started homeschooling and is on line to graduate early. I’d been telling her mother that that might help her, but she would always tell me she didn’t want to homeschool any of her kids because she didn’t want them to come out like me. Such a sweet thing to say. I’m so proud of my niece. She’s also got a little part time job and is currently saving for a car. She was actually the one who encouraged and inspired me to try working again. I don’t blame her in any way, but helping her do homeschooling is somewhat tiring. I’ll do it, though, if it means she can finish school and have a good future. 

The relationship between my family and I are extremely strained. Bills keep getting higher because they keep demanding things we don’t need or doing things that run up bills. We don’t need the A/C on all night. The tv doesn’t need to be on all night and even when they leave. They don’t need to leave the water running or every light on. I swear, it’s done on purpose. I rarely have money to just exist, let alone “have a life”. Yet, they keep making it harder and harder for me. I wish I could move out, but it’s still way too expensive and low-income housing is ultra full, lately, and I only see it getting worse because of everything that’s going on. 

However, I did make a friend from work! This person has been amazing and understanding. I’ve really never had a person who regularly asks me how I am or let’s me vent AND actually gives me words of support. She has great parents, though I have yet to meet them (corona, and her mother is sickly). Her boyfriend on the other hand, has a family similar to mine, which is probably why she’s so understanding. We have such a good connection, and I talk to her boyfriend, sometimes, too. He’s a cool guy. They are really the only bright spot in my life and I’m, weirdly, thankful for corona because they haven’t asked me to hang out or come over, so I don’t have to make excuses because I’m broke 95 percent of the time, lol. I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it and hope it doesn’t end up messing up one of the few good things in my life. 

I’m sorry to those I’ve not responded to. I’m sure you all understand how emotionally draining things can be and, unfortunately, offline life has to come first. I do thank anyone who did reach out and any talks we had. I got a decent amount of requests and it was kind of hard to keep up. Sorry again."
515,depression,I hate doing mistakes,"i did mistakes at work yesterday and i feel so burdened.

thank god i have friends that could help me to fix it but i still stay with a heavy mind"
516,depression,Daily Log 08.29.20.,"08.29.20.
I’m supposed to do many things today. It’s still morning but I want to have a good day. I want to be present, and just start. I haven’t felt fully present in so long. This is my first time using reddit and I don’t really know how it works yet, but hopefully this online community can comfort me a little. I also just want to record how I’m doing mentally to see progress hopefully. I’m at my lowest this year but at the same time I’m starting to become more aware of my conditions, and have a little more will to face it all. I wonder where this would go."
517,depression,Why I’m depressed,I started feeling depressed at the age of 13 and I’ve been dealing with it ever since I see people enjoying life and I feel like I don’t deserve it I cry myself to sleep I can barley eat I stay up all night if crying doesn’t work I’ve been alone for 4 years because I’m terrified of rejection I hate being alone but I’m alone because I don’t want to be rejected by a person I love my family abandoned me my friends stopped talking to me and every morning I wake up I ask myself “Is today the day I die?” I don’t enjoy life my brother took his life and my father passed away too they may of abandoned me but they’re still family my pets passed away this year and I hate being alone with no one that loves me I tried “self love” but I ended up worse idk what to do...
518,depression,Alone,"I have no one, I have no one to cheer me on, no one to tell how bad my day is or to kiss at the end of the day, I don’t have a place, I’m 20 sleeping in a friends hippy van, my family screwed me over more than this world did which is why I’m homeless now been homeless since 16, mom kicked me out because I reminded her to much of my dad, I was always mistreated and the no favor middle child so I got used to being alone I finished high school October of 2019 being 20 and finishing late make people look at you funny this is due to dropping out for 6 months my junior year  before I had a van to sleep in I was sleeping at parks and in front of school it got so bad I didn’t have nothing but a pothead friend who feed me some nights and smoked with me ( I was 16-17) 


I feel like my life has no meaning, I see all these people getting love, jobs, having an actual loving family, and they take that for granted and go out there way to be bad what I leaned in life is certainly not fair I got chose last for anything I got mad fun of by my own family
For being homeless I do good and karma spits in my face I’ve got broken down, and humiliated by people I thought I could trust, that I love, I spent New Years outside by myself eating a grill cheese I stole from cheddars while Working there, I used to walk from one city to another just to go to work, I quit last year in dec, I know I’m not shit and I’m fine with that at the end of the day I try to do right and make everybody I meet happy and leave a good impression on them it doesn’t take much to be nice. growing up In a (in your face family) and getting “you ain’t shit,etc” drilled in my head left me wanted to never treat my kid that way no matter how much I don’t like my Partner I’d never treat them like that because of my selfishness 
I guess what I’m typing is appreciate a good person, lover, or friend if you have one In Your life 
Because outta all the cold nights of being hungry, sleeping outside, getting sick, etc the only thing that really bother me was being alone, not having a single person being there rooting for me, no one to talk to when your feeling sad or alone. When I do have a good day it’s cut Down short because I don’t have no one to Discuss it with the worst day would probably have to be new year I always feel like there no one on earth thinking about me those nights no one should ever feel that way

I spend most of my days looking into film I do wanna become a film actor one day, I find joy in entertaining people those quick seconds of happiness make me feel there’s something worth living for being alone ain’t it"
519,depression,So tired,Just so tired. Of existing. Of feeling guilty for taking advantage of everything I have and my fucked up mind not appreciating it...wishing I can give it to someone who deserves it...feeling like a worthless piece of shit every day I wake up with life...being worthless to my son....to my family...wanting to better myself for them..:wishing I was normal...wondering why I’m such a fuck up....nothing helps!!! I’m so lost
520,depression,I hate life,Why me?? there are so many people and I get the worst things happening to me? Why couldn’t I have a happy life. It’s unfair. Does it all happen for a reason?
521,depression,My mind is just an echo chamber. I'm leaving.,"I have the same self depreciating thoughts bouncing around my head. There's nothing new. I've lost my creativity. I've lost what made me who I uniquely am. I am a shell. I'm am embarrassment. How can I expect anyone to want me when I am just a sad sack of shit? ANYWAYS; I'm done with this sub. I'm just saying what everyone else is saying. My mental troubles aren't unique. There is no one here who truly care. Save the ""supportive"" comments and DMs. I will just accept me for what I am now. People cringe when they see my posts. They're pathetic and embarrassing.  I'm a legal adult now so I have to grow up. I'll just get a fucking diary. No more of this sub or the self harm sub or the suicide watch sub. The next time I post on any of those subs it will be to alert you that I am finally going through with my suicide. Whatever. Typing this was embarrassing enough. Bye."
522,depression,Yesterday I tried to write my story and the app crashed as I was nearly done. You guys convinced me to try again today. Bet you weren't expecting a mini novel lol,"Yesterday, I took the time to write out everything that seemed to apply to my being depressed and more or less crippled by the weight of that depression.  I spent about an hour of my time re-hashing old traumas and bad decisions, and as I was close to finishing...My reddit app crashed and I lost it all.

Thankfully, a few kind redditors encouraged me to try again today.  So this is attempt number 2 at sharing my abbreviated life story.  I apologize if it’s too wordy, I’m known for not being able to tell short stories lol

So I want to start off by acknowledging the good in my life.  I have a lot to be grateful for and happy about.  I also believe my life has been pretty comfortable and easy compared to a lot of people I know.  I have a family that is kind and caring (more on that below), I have amazing friends and acquaintances, and I even have a best friend I consider a brother.  I am in good physical health for the most part.  I have never had to go without food or warmth outside of the consequences of my own actions.  I have 2 dogs that have literally been my heartbeat for the last few years.  Without them I was nothing but a drunken mess, spending most of my time crying on the floor of my parents spare bedroom.  They are literally why I get out of bed in the morning these days.  I’m not ugly (not that it’s super important, but it’s not something affecting my confidence) and while I’m kind of awkward sometimes, I know I am a good conversationalist. I don’t have an issue finding common ground to relate to people most of the time, and making people comfortable enough to be 100% real around me is something I pride myself on.  I have musical talent, a gift that has helped me through most of the hard times (also more on that below) and I’m not incompetent when it comes to using tools to create things that I need for my home, garden, or other random activities.

Okay, there’s some positives for you.  I know its a duality.  I know it’s not ALL bad.  I have things to live for.  I have reasons to fight and to hang on.  That being said...I’m just gonna dive right into the events throughout my life that have (from my perspective) shaped the person I am today.

So first I think it’s important to talk about my family, because they are an underlying theme of a lot of the things I’m going to talk about. After that, I’m gonna dive into my story starting at my childhood.

My mom and dad are still together, and have been for over 30 years.  I am 32, and my younger sister is 24.  We are all kind to each other and love each other.  My sister and I have always been super close, with a short period in our teens where we went different directions for a bit.  My parents have always supported me in everything I’ve ever wanted to do.  They never beat me or hit me, and always used their words to communicate my mistakes and short comings.  That being said, my family is absolutely dysfunctional.  My mom and dad are together, but their marriage is more like a couple of room mates who happen to have kids together.  My dad has slept on the couch ever since I was about 14, and I don’t remember the last time I saw my parents kiss or flirt or anything like that.  They get along really well these days for the most part, but there were some reallllllly rough spots in the past.

My dad is a very kind man, and he is very sociable.  However, he is sort’ve like a frat guy that never grew up.  He drinks beer every day, usually starting around 9 or 10 AM, and when he gets drunk it’s impossible to communicate with him.  Pointing out that he’s drunk makes him really mad and never helps solve anything.  He is not an abusive drunk, physically, though the case could be made for unintentional mental abuse.  He’s a good guy with a good heart for the most part.  But he always wanted to go party with his friends when I was a baby, and I have heard stories of my mother having to literally drag him out of bars before.  He used to take me to the bar with him when I was super young; I only have dream-like memories of this.  Nothing I can hold onto, but the flash of an image here and there if I concentrate.  He never hit any of us or anything, but a majority of the arguments between him and my mom were his fault.

My mom is great honestly.  She is the glue holding our family together.  She has always been quirky, but she’s very very intelligent.  She taught me to read by having me read “The tommyknockers” by stephen king as my first book LMAO!! She would read and I would follow and ask questions and slowly but surely I learned to read this way.  I don’t remember ever not being able to read, so I know this happened when I was super young.  This is probably the thing I am most grateful for in my whole life.  I loved reading throughout my whole life, and only really slowed down after college attempt number 1 (more on that below). She always plays devils advocate (which I hate, but appreciate) in an attempt to get me to either out-debate her, or to just strengthen my own views.  Mostly just to argue though it seems lol.  She is the breadwinner in our family.  She currently is the only person in our household working (my dad just randomly decided he was retiring this year even though he has no money saved, no income, and no plan) and while my dad sorta does a househusband kinda gig, he half asses it most days to the point that I personally see it as an insult to my mother. Especially since he’s spending her money on beer and then lying about how much and how often he drinks. (this has been a problem since before I was born).  The one thing about my mom that has negatively affected our family, is that she is (now mostly recovered) a hoarder.  Her mom, my grandmother is as well to a much more extreme degree.  It didn’t start until I was about 8 or 9, and we moved into the house we currently live in.  We moved because my sister was born and we needed more space, but it quickly began to just fill up with junk mail, unpacked boxes, trash, dirty dishes, and eventually animals.  It was a zoo at one point.  We had 11 cats, 3 dogs, a couple hamsters and guinea pigs, all of whiched pissed on the floors of the house pretty much indiscriminately.  It was a huge issue for me as a teenager (albeit a petty one in retrospect) because I was so embarrassed to have people over to my house...and I smelled pretty bad sometimes because of the proximity of my clothes to random piles of piss or shit.  It was bad for us and for the animals.  The only other thing she ever really did that bothered me happened pretty much when the internet first came out.  She would go to work, come home, get on the computer, and be on it til bedtime.  She would get mad if she couldnt use the computer right away when she got home and we had to beg and plead to get a few minutes here and there of her time or to use the computer.  Ultimately though, this didn’t affect me super negatively as much as it just annoyed me.

My sister….well really nothing negative to say here at all.  She’s the best of us.  The smartest, wisest, most successful so far, and just an inspiring and wonderful person to know.  I love her to death and I couldn’t have asked for a better confidant and partner in crime during my childhood.  I honestly can’t think of a single thing she has ever done or said other than regular kid stuff that has ever negatively affected me.  She’s just great, y’all.

That’s a bit about us individually, and just know that as a family, we have been blessed in that we really do have each others backs when it matters, and we’ve never had to go without food, warmth, or comfort during hard times.  We are truly a very lucky family.  That being said, I mentioned the dysfunction.  It’s hard to explain without me coming off as ungrateful, which is why I tried to list a lot of the positives up to this point.  I have never had a guide in my life.  I never had anyone who would talk to me about what life is and what I should be doing with it.  I know a lot of parents cross many boundaries in trying to force their kids to do things, but my parents have always been reaction based, and are almost never proactive.  If something wasn’t going wrong RIGHT THEN, it could be put off til later.  For years, I was left to my own devices as long as I wasn’t hurt, sick, or causing trouble.  My parents were just tired from working in my opinion, and they were happy to keep me distracted with video games.  I began to become obsessed with video games (still am today) and games quickly became an escape from reality for me.  I found myself going to school and sorta learning, but I have ADHD so most of the time I’d get bored and just read books.  My teachers mostly just let me because they saw I was reading novels.  In first grade I remember having to read and do a book report on this stupid “Boxcar Children” book series to prove I wasnt just pretending to read novels to not do school work.  I finished the book in like an hour and finished the report in less time than that lol.  They let me read whatever I wanted after that.  Things were fairly normal for the most part until my sister was born.

This is where things finally start to play into why I’m writing this in the first place.  If you’re still reading this, I thank you.  I tend to ramble and I’m trying my best to keep just the important stuff.

So when I was in 4th grade, my sister was born and we moved into the house we now live in.  I had to switch schools, and holy shit was I not ready.  My original elementary school was amazing.  I had friends there, and there was little to no bullying at all.  We pretty much all got along for the most part and it was an atmosphere of respect and kindness.  It was a complete 180 at my new school.  From day 1, the bullying began.  I got made fun of for my clothes being weird. Shorts too short, disney character on my shirt.  I didn’t stand up for myself so it got worse quickly.  It started with the insults which escalated quickly, from making fun of my clothes to literally being told “I bet you suck your own dad’s dick you faggot”.  I would normally just put my head down and cry when this happened because I didn’t understand what I had done to make them dislike me so much.  Then at recess, it started getting physical.  It was just shoving and a random punch here and there at first.  But it eventually escalated to me being punched and kicked while on the ground, surrounded by 3 or 4 boys all laughing while they beat me.  I finally managed to say something to my teacher about it AND HER SOLUTION WAS TO MAKE ME SHAKE THE HAND OF THE LEAD BULLY.  I’ll never forget the smug look on his face, or how he whispered “You shouldn’t have told on us” as he crushed my hand in that handshake.  I tried to tell my parents, but they were overwhelmed with work and my baby sister.  The most I ever got from them was a “Well, you know what they say isn’t true so don’t let it bother you.”  I never one got a conversation about standing up for myself, or how to protect myself.  So this went on all through elementary and middle school.  I had friends, but none that would stick up for me during the worst of it.  Eventually though in middle school I found Band, and things got a lot better.  I had friends with common interests, and a skill I could focus on improving that wasn’t just video games.  Those friends stayed with me through High school, and I still keep in contact with them today from time to time.

So at this point in my life, going into high school, I was VERY introverted.  I barely talked to anyone I didn’t know, and I constantly sought approval from others.  Any relationship I had (romantic or otherwise) I would cling to, as it gave me a sense of self.  If I mattered to someone else, then I mattered ya know?  I didn’t know myself at that point.  I didn’t know I was a person that needed self love.  Like I could see other people living their lives, but the thought never crossed my mind that I had to build my life the same way.  I was a spectator to everyone else living their lives, and I was just trying to stay out of the way and not be a burden.  High school was actually great for me.  I found marching band and jazz band and REALLY excelled at music.  I won scholarships and awards for playing the saxophone.  I was truly a monster, I won one of the highest achievable improv awards in the state for High school at the Purdue Jazz Festival my senior year. (not to brag, but to show that I took it very seriously). So I had something of my own that helped to begin to define me.  That was great for me.

My first year of college was a train wreck.  I begged my parents to help me with admissions and figuring out just what the hell I was supposed to be doing as far as getting enrolled and getting financial assistance.  They never helped me.  To this day, I still don’t know why.  I’ve talked to them about it and my mom basically just said she didn’t know any more than I did about it and I figured it out myself anyway so no harm done.  (that’s how she felt at the time, not how she feels now.)   I know lots of people have to do it all themselves, but for as big an introvert as I was, this was super difficult for me.  I managed somehow to pull it all together though and started that fall as a music major.  Things were great for a while, but 2 major factors came crashing together at the same time and ended my saxophone career.  The first was that I played so damn much every day that I developed TMJ.  It’s a jaw condition that is more or less like having tendonitis but in your face lol.  Needless to say, it became excruciatingly painful for me to play my horn.  At the same time, I was falling out with my saxophone professor because of his teaching methods.  He is an amazing sax player, but a horrible teacher.  He tried to force me to do everything exactly the way he did it (to be fair, it’s how he got so good) but he wouldn’t ever let me do things my way.  I play from feeling first usually.  I literally feel music and can hear it in my head perfectly.  I can’t always play or communicate what I’m hearing on the first try, but music to me is a language I can understand at the level of my soul.  I know it was important for me to learn all the ins and outs, but he was suffocating me.  I remember once, we had a performance and I had one of the lead solo’s in our closing number.  It was a super funky tune (can’t remember the name now) but I basically just got to spaz out for like 64 bars of funkadelic sax riffs.  Right before we went on stage, my professor asked me to play my solo NOTE FOR NOTE.  (I usually approached improv with a few rehearsed licks, but I would almost always just play what came to me in the moment, knowing I had some solid melodies to fall back on) So when I told him that I hadn’t memorized something to play, he took my solo away.  On the spot.  Knowing my friends and family were there and I had told them to expect my solo at the end of the show.

That was pretty much the final straw.  The day I dropped out of college (the first time) was the day he made me cry in his office because I tried to explain all of this to him and he pretty much just said “Too bad, you gotta play the music that gets you paid so you can play the music you want to play.”

That was one of the harshest truths I had ever heard up to that point.  In retrospect, he was right.  He also could have compromised with me to make sure he wasn’t killing any and all enjoyment I got from my instrument.  By this time, I could only play for 20 or 30 minutes at a time anyway before my jaw would either lock up or just start throbbing.  So I dropped out.

I got a full time job right away, and decided to move out of my parents house.  Home life wasn’t terrible or anything other than the hoarding and lack of functioning as a unit.  I just needed some independence.  After about a year and a half of working as a fork lift operator at Sweetwater Sound, I started feeling like I wasn’t being paid enough. I was only making $.75 an hour more than the new hires who just had to pack boxes.  Yet, I was the main forklift operator in the warehouse during the week.  I trained people, and even came in on weekends to organize things the way I liked them.  When I asked for a raise, they said they couldn’t budget it.  Meanwhile, the owner of the company BOUGHT A HELICOPTER and started flying to work a couple times a week even though he lived less than a 20 min drive from the building.  I couldn’t believe it.  He then proceeded to freeze wages warehouse-wide during christmas because he didn’t want anyone to get a raise right before we would be working 10 to 20 hours of overtime every week.  To date, this is one of the biggest slaps in the face an employer has ever delivered to me.

Next are some events that are worthy of a post of their own that lead to the next transition in my life, but to prevent this from becoming an even longer story, lets just say I made some questionable partying decisions that led to me almost getting arrested.  I decided pretty much out of nowhere that I was tired of being taken advantage of, and not happy with the path I was heading down.  The day after almost getting arrested, I walked into the recruiting office of the Indiana National Guard.  The recruiter promised me he could get me in ASAP, so I quit my job that day.  I got a 95 on the ASVAB, but chose infantry because I could get a $20k signing bonus and they could ship me to basic in only 2 weeks.  So literally 10 days after walking into that office, I left for Fort Benning, GA.  This is the part of the story where things get truly complex.  To anyone who has read this far, I truly thank you.

What I’m about to talk about, I have shared only with those closest to me in full detail.  I went on to write a lot of songs about this period of my life and the things I learned and experienced.  But this is going to be controversial.  I may catch some blowback from my opinions, but I’m gonna do my best to just tell exactly what happened without putting too much of my own perspective on it.

I had been in 7th grade when 9/11 happened.  I saw the second plane hit live on the news, and I always thought I would someday try to join the military to some degree, to do my part.  I bought into all the propaganda, and was kind of a “MURICA” asshole for a while.  So me joining the military wasn’t truly out of nowhere, other than that I was a scrawny lanky kid trying to join the infantry lol

So, after a few days at Camp Atturbury in Indiana where they did our processing, I shipped out to Ft Benning, GA AKA Sand Hill.  Upon arrival, we turned in our personal belongings and had our heads shaved.  Then they took us into an auditorium and had us sit.  There were probably between 100 and 200 of us, it’s hard to recall specifically as there was a lot going on around me and inside my head at that point.  They brought out a few CO’s and NCO’s to talk to us about what to expect over the next few weeks.  The last speaker however, was a chaplain (a religious officer if you don’t know, basically an army pastor).  The chaplain came out and one of the first things he said was something that still haunts me to this day.

“I know a lot of you are having internal conflicts about your decision, and that’s okay.  I’m here to tell you that GOD will NEVER punish you, for killing the enemies of America.”

I was shocked.  This was the same rhetoric our enemies were telling their troops.  My mother is an atheist and my father is one of those christians who never prays, reads the bible, or goes to church, or really anything at all other than say he’s a christian because his parents were.  I personally was agnostic, and mostly saw religion as a tool to control people at that point.  (I have developed my own spiritual beliefs as of this period of my life, but I was an asshole about not letting people act like their god made them better than anyone else).  So my natural instinct when confronted with something I can’t change is to go super introverted.  I locked my lips, kept my head down, and tried to fly under the radar.  I figured maybe if I could just get through basic training, it would be different at my unit.

Basic training was one of the greatest and worst times of my life.  I learned more about myself and what I’m capable of than any other period of my life, unquestionably.  I became physically strong, mentally disciplined, and even saw a potential path for a career in the military for myself.  I thought I could change things, or at least rise through the ranks enough to be an example of a different way to be.  I was wrong.  While I gained a lot of personal strength there, I gained even more psychological baggage.  The racism and nationalism is unbelievably strong, at least in my personal experience there.  Our drill sergeants would frequently refer to middle eastern people as “Sand N\*\*\*\*\*\*”.  I absolutely despise that word, and couldn’t believe my white drill sergeants were using it in front of my fellow black soldiers.  They just hijacked one of the most derogatory insults in history and started casually tossing it around towards another group they hated. It was disgusting.  They were trying to desensitize us for the very strong likelihood that we would someday have to kill these people, and I knew in my heart that I couldn’t bring myself to kill someone who wasn’t actively trying to kill me.  And if another country invaded mine, and soldiers came to my home and mistreated my innocent family members, I would probably attack them too.  I started seeing that it wasn’t such a simple issue.  There were many layers to what was happening overseas, and we were only hearing the parts that would help us be better suited to accomplishing the goals of the army, regardless of whether it was completely honorable or not.  This is where I fear I will lose most of you.  From my first hand experience, I don’t believe that our government or military has the best interests of it’s people at heart.  We can have a whole discussion about how soldiers are treated after coming back from war, and the almost complete lack of actual care they receive.  Let alone the fact that most of these wars are started by rich folks who wouldn’t even send their own children off to fight.

So needless to say, I felt even MORE introverted because I couldn’t really share how I felt with anyone around me.  I was so afraid of being seen as a traitor or terrorist because I honestly believed that we were not the good guys anymore.  (I still don’t support the majority of our government and its policies, but again, that’s another long conversation).   So this was a horrible time in life for me.  I was stuck in the army, hating the majority of it, and feeling like if I said anything I could end up in jail or military prison.  They REALLY scare the shit out of you at basic with the whole AWOL thing.  They try and make you believe that if you try to leave the military or if you don’t follow orders that they will court marshall you and try to put you away for as long as possible.  I didn’t even realize until wayyyy later in life how fucked up it is to have to threaten peoples literal lives to get them to conform to your ideology.

After a few months however, I graduated as an 11Bravo, and came back home an infantry soldier in the National Guard.  At my unit in my home town, things were a lot better.  I only had drill one weekend a month, and then a 2 to 3 week training camp in the summer time.  I met a lot of really good men and women at my unit, and for a short time, I had hope that my experience at basic was a standalone experience.  I even accepted a job as a recruiter for the Guard, and ended up recruiting a couple of my friends and a few others that my Squad leader and head recruiter basically tossed my way.  I made unbelievable money off of recruiting, which I now realize was so that I didn’t think too much about what I was doing.  I was convincing kids with no life experience that what I had done was the right way to go, while knowing in my heart I didn’t believe it to be true.  One of the worst things I’ve ever done in my life.  I still think about it from time to time and wonder if I caused anyone the same trauma I deal with.  I deserve it if I did.

So, eventually there came around an opportunity to go on a deployment to Afghanistan, on an agricultural mission.  It would have been mostly helping locals set up farms and sustainable living situations in areas affected by the war.  Seemed like I could finally do some good in the world.  But I was a private.  In the NG, if your unit isn’t the one being deployed, you can volunteer to join a unit that is being deployed.  However, it goes by rank first.  As a private I was at the bottom of the list.  NG deployments are honestly easy money if you don’t have family.  You get paid full time army pay, tax free, plus additional bonuses for being overseas in a combat zone, and MOSTLY the NG would just do base and convoy security.  We were essentially back up for the regular army, which compared to what the active duty soldiers had to deal with was a cake walk.

After being denied the deployment, I decided to try and shift gears.  I wanted to take advantage of my free college money and I set off for Indiana University, Bloomington.  I joined ROTC and decided that I would become an officer so that I could have some say in how things went around me.  I absolutely loved my time at IU.  I didn’t care for the military stuff as much, because it was basically again just a bunch of kids with no life experience being brainwashed towards certain ideologies and borderline nationalism.  I spent a year and a half at IU, trying to get a degree in Fitness and Nutrition, with my overall goal to become an officer that would help with physical training and overall health of soldiers.  It was my way of helping my soldiers, but not directly participating in violence.

Fast forward to the bailouts for the banks and the auto industry...One of the first things our state cut to afford the federal bail out was tuition for soldiers who had not been on a deployment that were currently in school.  So, even though I had volunteered for a deployment and been denied, they were going to cancel my school money, even though it was in my contract.  I couldn’t believe it.  I had done everything I was supposed to, even against my own morals at times, and then I got stuck with over 12,000 in back tuition.  I couldn’t afford it and it was clear I would have to drop out of school again.  I had reached my limit however with the army.

This part is another where I fear I will lose some of you, and that’s okay.  I wouldn’t expect you to understand if you hadn’t experienced it yourself.  But I decided to find a way out.  I had been tricked into working for an organization that didn’t care for me, and I was under threat of military prison if I tried to break it off.  Even if I dodged jail time, I would get a dishonorable discharge and that would ruin my future.  I wouldn’t ever be able to get a good job with that on my record.  This is probably where the biggest break in my mind happened, up to that point in my life.  I was absolutely terrified.  I didn’t know how friends and family would react.  I thought everyone would be disappointed or mad, or that they would see me as a traitor.  It’s almost impossible to confidently say “I do not support our governments actions, nor the direction it is heading” as a soldier.  It’s like signing your own death warrant.  You’ll be immediately cut off from most of your fellow soldiers, and judged by people you thought were your friends.  Luckily, I had a few people to confide in who understood my position even though they didn’t necessarily see it applied to them in the same way.  But never the less, I had enough support to decide to do SOMETHING.

I finally drove back to my unit in my home town to have the conversation about wanting to separate from the military.  That did not go well...AT ALL.

It was drill weekend so everyone was there.  I showed up unexpectedly, and was asked to wait in an office with some of the NCO’s until they got everyone going on training so we could talk.  I initially told them that I was there to talk about my status as an ROTC cadet (not a complete lie) and so they were fairly normal to me and mostly just wanted to talk about what training was like at IU.  Eventually however, the 1st sergeant of our company came in and that’s when shit hit the fan.  I somehow mustered the courage to squeak out the basic concept that I didn’t want to be a part of the army anymore.  My first sergeant exploded.  I have never in my life seen someone go from calm cool and collected, to ready to kill SO QUICKLY.  This man went OFF on me.  He began SCREAMING in my face that I was a traitor.  That I was stabbing every man in the back I had come to respect and serve with.  He called me any name he could think of that communicated how subhuman I was.  (never tried convincing me to stay I should note) it was horrible.  To this day, the most embarrassing moment of my life.  I was so ashamed.  I already felt unbearably guilty for being a failure as a soldier, and now this man was confirming everything I thought people might say about me.  He then told me I had to stay for the rest of the drill weekend (I had driven up just for that day because I had finals that week at IU, and wanted to at least finish out the semester before dropping out due to money.).  I wasn’t allowed to leave, and they said if I did that they would call the police.  They basically just had me hang out there the rest of the weekend, and they sent a few soldiers they knew were my friends one by one to talk to me.  Once they realized I wasn’t changing my mind, they just left me alone.

Then something amazing happened.  Our supply sergeant, who had been a solid mentor before I went to IU asked me to drive with him back to my home town (they were training out of city) with him.  Supply left early so that when everyone else arrived, they could check all the gear back in quicker and get everyone on their way.  On the way back he basically told me that if I helped him get all set up back at the base, I could leave before everyone else came back.  I was so grateful that I worked harder than I ever had when we got back.  I busted my ass to unload and put trucks and gear away before the majority of our company made it back.  This sergeant then called me into his office and had a conversation with me that literally saved my sanity.

He didn’t make me elaborate on my feelings too deeply, but he could see that I had transformed.  Before I left for IU, I was very strong willed, strong physically, and SUPER gung ho about the army.  I wanted to go to ranger school and he was helping me train.  The person in front of him now however was a broken, terrified, child in pain.  He basically told me that since I was only a private, and since I had all my gear turned in, that I could just leave and never come back.  He said that in the NG, going AWOL can have a few consequences.  They can prosecute you, and request jail time or money, they can take away your rank and force you to carry out the terms of your contract or send you to jail, among other things.  But what he said next I almost couldn’t believe.

His exact words were “Sometimes, we just let people go because it isn’t worth the paperwork.  Is it really that bad, man?”

I couldn’t even meet his eyes because of the tears in mine, but I nodded.  He said Okay, and told me I was free to go.  I literally sprinted out that building to my car (my girlfriend that drove with me from IU had left it in our hometown for me and had her parents drive her back...yeah, she’s awesome, we are still cool to this day) and began uncontrollably sobbing the moment I got behind the wheel  As soon as I could drive, I did.  I didn’t want the rest of my company to show up and to see me so broken.  On my drive to my parents house, the supply sergeant called my phone.  He asked me one final time if I was sure about my decision, then he wished me well and sent me on my way.

I calmed myself enough to drive back to IU (a 3 hour drive from my home town) and took my finals that week before officially dropping out.  I moved back in with my parents in my home town, now 23 years old and with nothing of my own to my name except my car.  I had to pay back my signing bonus so I literally had nothing left, and I was still stuck with my debt to IU.  A few weeks passed and I got a package in the mail from the National Guard.  Inside were discharge papers, and a certificate for a General Discharge under honorable conditions.  I had a guardian angel in the shape of a supply sergeant who pulled some strings for a guy he didn’t owe a damn thing to.  I’ll never forget that.

The relief I felt that day, is almost indescribable.  All at once, my fear and outright terror subsided.  I had managed to get myself out of a horrible situation, and I even had a chance at a future.  It was one of the happiest periods of my life.  I got a job as a server at Olive Garden and fell in love with the job.  I had been an introvert all my life, but my experiences in college and in the army had helped me deal with that and for the first time in my life, I was confident and social.  I was a great server.  I enjoyed the fact that I spent all day making people satisfied and happy, and I LOVED MY CO WORKERS.  To this day, I’m still friends with the majority of those people.  I worked there for about 2 years and dont regret a single day of it.  During that time I partied a lot.  Slept around.  Dated. Tried to just live a normal life.

Something I should have mentioned earlier, is that during the time I was at IU I got back into music.  Its another long story, but I got SUPER into hip hop music.  I realized all the jazz and music theory I learned applied directly to Hip hop, and after writing my first rap and leaving all my friends jaw dropped, I knew I had something special.  I used rap to talk about everything that was happening with the military and my state of mind.  This was my way of getting it out of me without directly telling anyone.  A funny thing about rap, is that even if you’re talking about how depressed you are; if you sound cool while doing it, people pay attention to the rhythm and flow, and not as much what you’re saying.  I’ll leave a link to my last free mixtape at the end of this, as proof of skill lol But, it’s truly super important to the next chapter of my life.

I decided I was going to be a rapper.  I know.  Trust me, I know.  But honestly, I’m great at it.  I understand words and music to a level that rhyming and forming cadences comes more naturally to me than anything else in the world.  I probably could have made this whole post rhyme and flow if I wanted to lol  I started writing and recording non stop, trying to improve myself and to start showing people I knew what I was doing.  After separating from the army and moving back to my home town, I started making music with co workers and other artists I met in my city, and eventually became part of a group called Far From Fake.  All of our music was about our disappointment in the music industry, and about how far rap had fallen.  Rap is in my opinion one of the greatest art forms humans have ever created, when done right.  The amount of information and emotion one can convey in a song is borderline magical.  Some of the things I’ve written I don’t understand to this day how it all fell into place.  Like for example, one line I wrote that I still love is:

“This needs more than assessment,

Supreme court intervention,

This my country,

And I swore to protect it,

From all enemies both foreign and domestic”

Say that out loud with the commas being the end of each bar and I think you’ll see what I mean.

So for a few years, my fellow artist friends and I played shows and tried to build up our online presence (although I admit I never took it as seriously as I should have, because part of me was still afraid of exposing myself to society because I didn’t want to directly talk about what happened to me in the military.  I thought I’d be seen as a traitor still).  We had great times and wrote some really dope music.  Then….I fell in love harder than I ever had before.

So I try and try and try to change things but my luck is so bad and I always end up worse than before. I feel as if I’m being tortured by demons everyday and God our father in heaven has just forsaken me.

I can’t stand the fact that I’ve never had a girlfriend. Everyoneeeee around me just seems to move on in life and get things and develop connections while I’m trapped. NOTHING EVER CHANGES FOR ME. 

The fact that I have no money and try to get a job but never succeed kills me. I live in a terrrible house environment and my mentality and spirit have honestly just died. 

I am constantly wishing for death and would commit suicide easily but I don’t want to hurt my family and have people remember me as the guy who killed himself.

I’m literally tortured by my life and mind every second of everyday and I’m just trying to survive but I am going insane. I used to go to the gym and it used to help me a lot mentally but I’m not allowed to go now because of corona fucking virus. 

Please pray for my death someone I’m suffering so bad help me."

535,depression,Recently heartbroken and falling deeper into depression.,"Hey everyone,

Just wondering if anyone had any advice dealing with heartbreak. I was with a girl for about 6 months and really believed she was the one. She was always supportive of my mental health struggles because she too had struggled in the past. She broke things off with me quite abruptly about a month ago and I’ve had no luck getting over things, if anything it’s just as painful as day one. I’ve been exercising, meditating, going to therapy, and trying to tell myself I’m still worthy of love but it’s a real struggle. My depression has been set to 11 since and I don’t know what to do. Any suggestions are appreciated."
536,depression,"Whenever i meet people i know when going for a walk and they ask me what am i doing in my life, it kills me.","It just happened,i met a high school friend that now is sucessfull. I felt uncomfortable the whole time talking to him and after we went our separate ways i just felt the need to smack my head against a wall or to disappear istantly"
537,depression,I swear im fucked in the head n theres no fixing it,"So i have a few things like ptsd, dissasosation from reality and borderline personality disorder (all medically diegnosed) from my dad n a few other things... ive been heavily emosonally abused by him since 2 being told no1 will ever love me trust no1 ect. Being hit/locked in cages made to smoke pot at 5 n do ice at 12  saw a guys neck get cut infrount of me n watched him bleed to death at 11 also saw a close  family member being raped at the same age. Im 16 now i have had a girlfriend for 18months but i have voices in my head that are more powerful then me i love her so much but i push her away cos these fucking voices tell me shes cheating ect. On top of this they tell me to kill anyone who says anything that pisses me off and are constently trying to convince me to kill myself (3 failed attempts) will these cunts in my head ever go away?"
538,depression,"The heartbreaking truth about being ""The funny friend""... it fucking sucks and I can't take it anymore. I just want something to change before I do something really stupid.....","Every day just keeps getting worse... I wish I was able to not give a fuck about anything but I guess I'm just not wired like that. I just wish there wasn't so much pressure put on me by all the little groups I'm in to have certain things or reach certain milestones on the same timeline as everyone else. I wish I was able to just do things at my own pace without feeling like I have someone to impress. I just wanna be me for fucking once. I'm so damn sick of having to try and impress people, bro... I just don't wanna keep playing this character that they've made me play.

When you're the funny friend it is SO hard to open up to people. Every fucking day I hope SOMEONE, ANYONE can see through this mask I've put up. But how could they? They're too busy laughing at my pain, telling me how strong I am to make light out of such dark situations. Every time I go somewhere with my mates, I'm always the one motivating and consoling them, only for me to home and be depressed all by myself. Truth be told, I'm so scared about what would happen if I stopped laughing. I use jokes as a defence mechanism to convince my friends, as well as myself that I am truly okay. But real shit... I'm not, and I haven't been for a while. It's so incredibly hard to open up to ANYONE because of that. I always tell myself that I'm going to reveal to my friends how I really feel when they ask me ""you okay?"" but I always just end up cracking another joke and I hate myself for it. I just need someone to talk to that doesn't expect me to make them laugh. I'm smiling and laughing on the inside but on the inside, I can't fucking handle living anymore. I always wonder if people would genuinely give a fuck if I killed myself or just randomly left because honestly, I think they just keep me around so I can make them laugh.

I just need someone to let me know why I should just leave... cos I'm just so sick of this shit honestly. "
539,depression,I wish I wasn’t black,"Life seems way more difficult as a black person, especially since being on social media and reading/watching the news.
Being white would be worth it. No one gives a fuck about blacks... not even each other.

540,depression,Today I had my first suicidal thoughts in my life.,"All my life I’ve generally been a very happy go lucky person, and had never really experienced severe depression, just a small rut every now and again, but quarantine hit me hard and took a serious toll on my mental health. Today I found myself absentmindedly thinking about killing myself (how I would do it, if anyone would miss me, etc.), and when I realized what I was thinking about, it terrified me.

I don’t know what to do, can somebody please help?"
541,depression,this is fucked up,"everything 

no talents, hobbies, relationships or anything really. Too tired or numb everyday to react to external stimulus of any kind. I fantasize of a time when I could be funny or helpful, could add something to a conversation or someone's life, but instead I stare at the fucking floor and do nothing but look like a fucking dumb cunt with no reason to be anywhere as cv v1 wcgduchhdvachsi hhsvcavsj is vsgxyu hhAAAAAAAAA

544,depression,"I don’t know where to go anymore, feeling lonely and hopeless.","I lost my job that I loved earlier this year to the pandemic. Had to break up with my boyfriend recently because of how much we were fighting. I had a small but decent online following for my art that was keeping me busy and hopeful during quarantine and right after the breakup I lost 90% of my engagement for no discernible reason other than the algorithm.  

After losing all these things I realized how few friends I have now, especially friends that care about me. Thanks to everything happening I feel almost invisible to the world.

I feel so lost and like no men will want me anymore and no one will want to be friends with me. I’m unemployed, feeling directionless in my career now, and I’m almost 23. I feel like I should have had more of my life figured out by now, and I thought I did before I lost these things that meant a lot to me. 

Trying to stay strong.. I have had severe depression and suicidal ideation in the past but worked so hard to get out of that hole and achieve the things I want. Now I feel worthless but I am trying to stay strong and not slip into the mentality I used to have, but it is difficult.."
545,depression,What do you do when depression threatens to swallow you whole?,"I have never been aware of the instability of my thoughts until recently. The intensity of my mind’s want to discontinue living is so boldly apparent it does not care when to present its darkest yearnings. 

I have been working on removing emotional blockages since I am a fiercely guarded person and also confronting the world of fantasy I have created for myself to live in since childhood. These walls of comfort are no longer there to save me and removing a fantasy to see that reality is at best worse than your daydreams is debilitating. It makes actual living appear worth less.  

I ask, when presented with the bottom of the barrel what are ways you create puddles of light?"

Food used to be my only happiness, but now im trying to lose weight and i’m not eating so much anymore, and I’m just so bored. I don’t know what to do with my day anymore. It was a distraction for me. Now I have to find other distractions.

College is a good one, but once I’m done with class, it’s back to remembering how fucking shit I feel.

550,depression,Useless,"Being an “attention seeking teenager” as someone on the internet said, I guess that’s all I am and all I’ll ever be. This whole post is just for people to recognize if you take your time to read this for whatever reason  


I was looking forward to graduating and never having to go back to school again. And that school is for “special” kids. And I’m just a normal person. But apparently I am unable to make it seem like I am one. All I ever wanted was to just get to talk to people normally and not seem weird or stupid or whatever. I thought that when I was 7 years old that by.   
The only people I know are my parents and I love them all very much and they love me. I shouldn’t take them for granted and I don’t. But I’m not a kid anymore so I can’t hide behind them, or just imagine what it’s gonna be like in the future where everything is epic and I do great things for the world

I’ll never have friends, start a family, get a job.....

And the last thing I want is to use the fact that apparently I had to go to a “special” school for people to give me a chance at anything. Because one time I was at this (non school related) class and my dad had to go in there and tell the teacher that I go to a “special“ school. 

I’m just a normal person 

but not like being normal  matters anyways when you’re just straight up useless anyways. There are people suffering in the world and I don’t do anything to help anyone. Anyone who was born with the great life I have, great parents and everything, didn’t grow up poor.... shouldn’t be useless like I am. And it’s not even an option to become not useless.    


&amp;#x200B;

All I wanted was advice on what I could possibly do, but after seeing the person saying I was an attention seeking teenager that should leave because the forum is for real 

&amp;#x200B;

But now I realize that

&amp;#x200B;

and I’m not doing anything at all

this post just looks really weird and has bad grammar but I’m just gonna leave it because it’s the least important thing to be concerned about"
551,depression,Personality Transformation: A phenomenon,"Has anyone experienced a personality transformation while taking SSRIS and then relapsed to their previous state after abruptly quitting? 
I took 50mg of Zoloft for post vacation depression four years ago not knowing it would radically transform my personality for two consecutive years. My neuroticism was non-existent and I became high in extroversion, confident, and positive. I’ve tried everything to return to those good times but have had little success and worsening symptoms. I recently started Prozac, Wellbutrin and clonazepam. However, I’ve made some possible connections between my chronic lower back pain which seems to coincide with depression. I’m also right hemispheric dominate which means my right hemisphere of my brain is more sensitive to pain. Does anyone know if pain could be the cause of depression or is the depression causing lower back pain?"
552,depression,Can’t make myself study...,"Especially during this pandemic, majority of my classes are online and I can’t do anything. Before the pandemic my depression would make it hard for me to find energy to do homework and study. But now, I can’t do anything. Depression + Less motivation due to the pandemic.

Can’t do anything else either. Besides go to the gym and sometimes kick the ball around in my backyard for 10 mins."
553,depression,I Hate Being Me,"I honestly just wish people would stop judging me I pretend to not care and to Brush it off but no matter what I feel like people are watching me walk looking at me for how I look and I hate it just want to be truly happy for once 

I’ve been laughing and smiling thanks to a few people but when they go or I’m not laughing I don’t even feel sad I just feel empty like the feelings I had have just gone 

I like this girl quite a bit but I can’t tell her I can’t bring myself to but yet I also kinda feel empty like I have no feeling for her or others but I do sometimes it’s strange I just wish I didn’t do this to myself and torture myself all the time 

The headaches have even started again I don’t know why but I just don’t want to sleep at night and when I wake up I just want to go back to sleep 

I have a job trial on Monday and honestly I don’t even want to go to it"
554,depression,Idk what to say. Depression is killing me.,"I have some days where I feel great, some where I feel absolutely dreadful. Today is one of those bad days.

555,depression,I don’t want to see anyone,When I’m depressed I don’t want to see or talk to anyone. I want to just get stoned and isolate myself away from everyone and the world.
556,depression,To the people who said 'It gets better'...,"To the people who said 'It gets better' in the past; to the people who found something worth living for, what did you find? How is life now? Is it still better? I know being happy is a feeling, not a destination, but when life took a shit on you again, was it easier after knowing what happiness was? 

I can't remember what being happy feels like. I don't remember much of anything anymore. I look at my past and, rather than memories, it's more just... this feeling of sadness. Like all I can remember is being sad. Like that's all I am and all I ever was. And I'm so tired."
557,depression,I don’t know if I’m depressed or just sad,I’m a teenager and sometimes I feel like I can’t be depressed because of that. I’ve been wanting to kill myself for years and feel unwanted. At social gatherings I just sit in the corner and cry. I really hate myself and just want to die. Could I have depression or am I just a moody teen??
558,depression,Vent,"With all the mental illnesses I have I'm starting to feel helpless, that I'm broken by these mental illnesses that they control me, how can I be happy? I'm so tired of just being sad all the time, it's like no matter how much I try I don't know how I can be happy. I don't know what i am doing with my life anymore, I'm feeling very lost alone and scared for my future. I feel like maybe I'm just extremely unlucky you know. During the day whether it was good or not by the end of the day I go to my bedroom by myself, in the dark with only my thoughts and the feeling of helplessness at 2 am to 3 am in the morning. I don't like the word hopeless because I interprete hopelessness with giving up. When I start saying the word hopeless that basically means I give up in my brain so instead I say helpless, because it makes more sense, I'm stuck at home without mental professional help. I feel like just because I'm autistic it means I'm a retard and I'm so extremely stupid, I look up my autism and the first thing I see is ""do people with autism feel emotions?"" Let me tell you something, we do it's so strong of emotions the second leading death for premature death is suicide. I don't understand the stigma with the mentally ill, it wasn't my choice, if it was, that would be amazing I would get rid of it in a heartbeat ,because then i wouldn't be seen as different, as stupid, as awkward. I just want to be accepted into society but I feel the energy of people judging me Everytime I tell them I have a mental illness. I feel like a monster that doesn't belong, I feel alone. I guess that's why I had to grow up so fast it's because even at a young age I understood that I was different I truly feel like I got fucked by godhimself. I had to fight my way through middle school to make it to at least make it to 11 years old that used to be my goal when I was in a mental hospital for almost attempting taking my own life. and now I'm in highschool I felt like I had a fresh start but then 2020 threw me down a flight of stairs and now IM. IN. A. DEPRESSED. STATE. AGAIN! I feel so angry. Angry at myself angry at some sort of invisible God. I had fights with family because I'm always mad now, Im not mad at them I'm mad at myself, I usually am not aggressive and not funny but ever since I have got my depression I have been aggressive bit at least I'm funny now. Tbh I'm just tired of dealing with this stuff. I feel like all the progress I made in five years just vanished before my very eyes."
559,depression,Does anyone have friends or family who are also depressed?,"I've been dealing with depression since 12 years old. This whole time I've been balancing on a knife edge to stay positive and the slightest thing tips me over and I have to struggle for a long time to climb back up.

My sister has been struggling also. She copes in a different way to me. 
The way I cope with it is to stay disciplined with a routine, good diet, good exercise and sleep whether I feel like it or not I HAVE to stick to it. These are things I can control. I've tried positive thinking and all that bs but to be honest it felt like I was lying to myself. I don't really talk to other about it other than letting people know I'm feeling shit and maybe the odd post on here other other accounts so my depressed self can stay hidden. 
My sister on the other hand likes to vent to me. Every so often I'll get a 2000 word essay about her experiences and her feelings. As much as I'd like to be there for her I feel myself slipping back as I read through her stories. 
I feel angry because of it. I say to myself how selfish can you be that you project your bullshit onto others and expect them to come running to your aid when we're all fighting to keep ourselves afloat?
She had a vent on new years eve and I flipped. I told her how I felt and how it ruined my new years. I posted about it in AITA and I was the asshole according to most folk. 

Now recently my wife has confessed she's been depressed and I've been listening to her stories about her self image problems and suicidal thoughts. I've done my best to be there for her. Listen to her hug her when she cries.
The longer it goes on, the more I feel myself slipping back and getting those thoughts of how selfish can you be?

Writing this out I'm feeling quite selfish for 1. thinking these things about my loved ones and 2. Projecting my bs onto you guys.

I guess I wanted to know if any of you have been through the same

TL;DR - I'm depressed but managed it okay so far. Loved ones also depressed and helping them is making me depressed again."
560,depression,i don't know what i am and i feel like such a fake,"i don't know what i am anymore. there's this answer i'm looking for about myself that i cant fucking find. i cant tell if i'm depressed or not, i harm myself daily but i feel nothing. but then i think ""since you say that you're feeling nothing you're faking it."" and then i rethink everything and over analyze my day and my head spins 

i have no real thoughts anymore. i feel like my thoughts are tape with fuzz all over it because they don't stick. 

i cant tell if im actually doing okay or if i'm just numb. and not being able to tell is killing me. my hygiene is still bad, i harm myself daily, and i sleep a lot but i still cant fucking tell.

and part of me wants to get bad again because i want to die but i just don't have it in me right now i guess. i want to get bad so the time is right because deep down i know that's the only way things can go

i'm an absolute mess and i'm just praying for the day that everything crashes down in my head like a chandelier and i can think and feel again and cry and hope and fall into the deep pit i'm always in but not always aware of

i'm just so confused and it's driving me fucking crazy. the scary thing is is i don't even know where these words about my ""feelings"" are coming from because i dont feel anytbing at all i think.

all my trauma is put into a little bottle on the shelf of my mind and it's put away but it doesn't hurt me right now because i'm numb, the memories are bland and tasteless and merely a flit of color so it's like they don't even exist right now and i hate it i want to remember and i want to cry

i need therapy but i can't get it so hopefully my mind falls to pieces again so i can pick them up again and throw them out a window

i see my friends struggling and i get so fucking jealous and i feel so awful i want to be them but not to reach out just to decompose

i don't know what i am anymore am i real and i fake am i numb or am i okay i will never know until i rest in the sleep of peace"

It’s the only thing keeping me from literally going over the edge of sanity. I always joke about how I’m a failure or about how I crave the sweet release of death. I know those jokes aren’t very funny in the first place, but it helps me cope, and everyone gets soooo pissed at me and said that it’s too sensitive of a subject to joke about.

563,depression,It's a bit sad how hard it is to get professional help,"I have been on my medication for a while now. I started my freshman year in college and now I'm in grad school. Everything was alright (in terms of making an appointment) in undergrad. The psychiatrist said that I can just call him after graduation to get an appointment as his office. I called at least five times on different dates and times during the summer. No one picked up. Nothing was done even if I left voice messages.

I have United Healthcare so I searched in-network providers. It was hard to find psychiatrists with decent reviews from the start. Of those that I thought were alright, two of them never picked up, one said they'll call back and never did, one had an attitude and I thought that isn't a good sign (I know it's just the reception lady, but when you're looking for help at a venerable mental state that hurts), and one actually called back (which I was very surprised) and thankfully I have an appointment for two weeks later. He's a psychiatrist with the best ratings online, at least based on a dozen of them that I searched for.

I've done my research and read that there's just not enough psychiatrists/dealing with insurance is a horrible experience for them. I understand. I just think it's a bit sad that people have to search this hard to get any help. I'm in an okay mental state right now so I managed to continue my search, but I imagine situations where people with severe mental health issues not being able to find anyone and feeling like nobody cares enough. I wish it were easier for us to get help."

I am the worst thing ever. I deserve to be punished and cast aside. I tried to kill myself but I wasn't even good at it. I wasn't successful, because if I had been, I would not be suffering. I regret surviving my suicide attempt, I really do!, I am nothing and nothing I'll become!"

I’ve had it for a day and I already crashed it by not hitting the breaks hard enough. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I took lessons and practiced and I finally got a car and rear ended someone and the kicker, they had a kid in the car. I’ve been crying nonstop and I feel worthless and like a disappointment. I broke my  3 year streak of not self harming and I just feel worthless.

568,depression,Mr. Rogers has actually been a huge inspiration in my life,"Believe it or not, I didn’t grow up watching his show. I wish I did. I found him out later in life, and his emotional intelligence always hits me a certain way. I saw the movie with Tom Hanks and looked into how he lived his life. His quotes always reflected the world I wanted to live in.         

I know I will always have depression. I know I can get a little too worked up sometimes. Seeing how he sees the world has helped me so much. For my date tomorrow with my wife, we are driving around and giving goods to the homeless. Mr. Rogers always told us to look for the helpers and that’s who I enjoy being. It’s like if I can try to make someone else’s day better who could use it, maybe that helps me live in the world he saw rather than the world that I see on the news. Freaking out about current events never helped, but ignoring the world completely to help people how I can actually makes the world look better.

And it's not like they're the busiest people. They NEVER do this. My Grandparents have custody of me and they don't care. I have to take care of my senile grandmother because she's handicapped and can't walk. 

My parents dumped me here 7 years ago, (im 15 btw). They have put me through hell. My grandparents have harassed my family members to take me because she hates me because my parents robbed them and dumped us there. 

I'm also homeschooled, and have been since they dumped me here. I have suffered with extreme depression and nobody in my real life cares, or sits down to talk to me. I have 1 online friend who cares. She's all I have but it's just not the same. She lives millions of miles away. It's just not as personal. I don't know what to do. There's nothing I can do. 

I just want to be okay without people. But it's so hard considering that my own parents don't want me, and my grandparents threaten to kick me out almost everyday, I just... I dont know. Im lost and confused, mainly stuck."
570,depression,“Well you must want to be miserable”,"I’ve been working from home during pandemic, but partner is currently not working. I mentioned ‘it’s Friday! I wish there was something we could do’. And my partner asked ‘in the middle of a pandemic? What would you even want to do’ and I responded ‘idk, I just miss being able to do things on the weekend’. And we had a hypothetical convo about things we used to do before COVID and in the middle of it my partner flipped and said ‘well why don’t you try to do those things and have fun getting sick’. I mentioned that we were speaking hypothetically and that there isn’t much to do while quarantining. 

My partner looked me dead in the face and said ‘well you must want to be miserable. If you’re not part of the solution you’re part of the problem’. 

And it honestly took every bone in my body to not respond angrily. I’ve watched, and supported, and taken all that comes with loving someone through depression. So many suggestions and offers on things to do, while not trying to be resentful that my partner isn’t seeking support or making strides to do things differently. 

TLDR: my spouse said the words to me that I’ve been holding back for 3 months and I’m trying to let it go but it’s hard."

It used to be cultivated, as much as I hated it I have to thank my parents for pushing me into activities. I'm... not saying my age but my high school life was wasted, i did jack shit, nothing worthwhile at least. Some late join stage techie or a high school play, and some nerd in a half baked D&amp;D group. My job digs cracks in my stagnated bones and movement makes my muscles fill with tar. The relationships I once clung to, I've begun to notice it. The one reason I held on I can't keep fighting for. In interest of this being mostly anonymous, I'm speaking of the rose.

Let me quickly describe how i see the (metaphorical) world. Its a giant floating island, somewhere between the void and limbo, the void being down and limbo being high above. On the island is everything that made your childhood, its's your bubble. It would grow the older you got, but it has a price to live on: you have to fight to stay. You cant give up he fight, not for one second, otherwise it throws you off. Now, when your on the island, it's your reason to live, but around the island is a wall you cant ever scale, but there were holes, the wall with pockets of flowers, fauna, trees, etc. Those small gardens that the plants made their home in. They lost their fight but clung to life. If you fell too far you sunk into the void, but you could hang in that little middle area, between the void and life. The plants made their life there, taking root and doing their best to cling. I'm not sure if there are others like me, those who had to cling to those around them to stop them from sinking. I used to float down in that middle space during the night, to see what it was like. That's when I met the Rose.

The rose has been my only constant friend for the past 6 years. When I met it, I mistook it for a simple dulled rose, nothing super wrong, but still messed up. Over time it came forth about how much pain it was in, how the leaves on its stem would suck away its energy, how much it hurt to live as wilted as they were, how angry they were that they were ripped from their forest and put in this garden. When I learned, I did my best to help. Id aide in the untangling of vines, I would stop the rose from scarring itself with its thorns. I never noticed it till now, but the rose didn't treat me the same. I remember when the rose fell in love with the dandelion, and I was overjoyed, mostly for them, but slightly because I no longer had to clean the mess of the rose's thorns by myself. then, the dandelion faded into the fluffy white cloud, seemingly leaving just to remain. to make a long story short, The dandelion stayed, but its' and the rose's roots removed each other from theirs. 

In the middle of that, I found the nightshade. I don't know what flower I am, I cant look myself in the mirror long enough to figure it out. But the nightshade thought we were made for each other. I... didn't, not enough to match the Nightshade, but nonetheless I allowed it's roots to entangle mine. I have...fogged those memories, but i remember that I never felt wholly comfy, but nonetheless, I was with someone other than the Rose. Even now, even with what I presently feel, I still feel guilty, the rose didn't see anyone, literally, and all I could do was say how happy i was to be ""away from the Rose's whining"". i hate myself for that. In the end, I was able to get my face in the sun, even if the sun was the rose masquerading. I agreed in the end. I ripped my roots away from the nightshades, and in retaliation it tore up th garden we made. I still laugh at that. I am not a good person. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, me and the rose were away from those ""fakers"". I was content. At this point, I had long fallen from my island, and floated between the Rose's and I's garden, simply for the company. But then the dandelion came back. I stepped back, and looked at my hands. 

&amp;#x200B;

All i see is those scars and lacerations on my wrists and hands, even my face, as the thanks for helping take care of the rose for many years. I looked at the path the rose made me crawl through. I see the cuts, the blood, the scars. I had been their friend for so long, i forgot to be mine. I cant drag myself trough those thorns again, but i look down at my old fried the void, he draws closer, or rather I draw closer to him, even as I type this, the Rose's thorns are there for me to grab onto, my only lifeboat. 

The Rose. The one I made sure had water, made sure had food, the one I helped through my darkest hours with no complaint. The rose who refuses to unwilt. I am not allowed to complain about the lacerations to my hands, arms, and  legs. I cannot complain of my heart of drained sand. After all ""Your pain can't compare to that of a Rose who is wilted and was forced to this garden."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate the rose, but I cant find my spark. I cant call on the Island to take me back. There is nothing for me there. So here I am, saying my goodbye mostly. I don't plan on staying here much longer. Earlier I said I didn't know what plant I was, but I think I get it now: I'm a forget-me-not. A reminder of death in western culture, for funerals. ironic, that the one used for funerals will likely need one before the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the odd pace and structure, I needed to vent. Ill leave a key of some sorts to help  people why I used the plants I did, for those who want it.

&amp;#x200B;

The (wilted) Rose: Roses are known for being fragile, for needing the perfect conditions to survive. If you don't give them that they wilt. Even when given that they wilt. The wilted rose is the second one in my opinion. Their thorns hurt.

The dandelion: Not something special, but resilent. The dandelion can grow anywhere, it seems. It rolls with the punches, but will become that cloud that wants to fly away in the wind. evasive but well meaning.

The Nightshade: Nightshades are known for being toxic. their poison is deadly if not treated. The nightshade in my life would poison my thoughts or bring the worse ones to light for a joke. The nightshade is the one i spent the least time with, but is the third most thought of. 

The forget-me-not(or...me): forget me not's aren't known for being fragile, but they can't grow anywhere. they have to be cultivated as much as any other flower. but their cultivation is for funerals in the western hemisphere. Grown to be cut and left as a memorial. And at this point, all I can think of is how i can make my funeral memorialized. I can think of how to make death something less sad at that casket. I want to cut my on stem, and lay to rest as my own memorial. I think I'll be the first to need me, and the last."
573,depression,I can’t figure out what’s wrong with me ??,"Hey guys so I’ve never been formally diagnosed with any kind of mental health disorders or anything (mainly because I’ve never had the courage to ask my mom to go see a professional), but this has been going on for SO long that I think that this might be more serious than i thought (or in my mom’s words maybe I’m just overreacting and need to stop using my phone so much. I don’t deny that I need to reduce my screen time, but I went through a week during quarantine where I used my phone for an hour or less per day and nothing changed sooo).
I guess for reference, I’m a junior in high school, and I take a lot of AP classes lol. I’ve also always been on the pessimistic side, but I always attributed that to my personality.

Basically, ever since 7th/8th grade, I can’t remember a single day when I felt refreshed and my mind felt clear. Not a single day. And I’m always so, so tired. It feels like I’ve had a headache every single day of my life. 

I’m a pretty hard worker and I usually don’t procrastinate, so I’ve never really questioned my mental state. But throughout quarantine I realized the only reason why that‘s been true for the last several years was because my schedule FORCED me to be productive and not procrastinate. I was always so busy that I had no time to even think about procrastinating (I mean that’s probably part of the problem).
See, I did go through a period in 6th grade where I wanted to kill myself because of my parents’ divorce issues. I snapped out of that phase pretty quickly for all things considered, but I never considered that I’m maybe not fully healed from that.

I’m not like sad on a day-to-day basis ? I mean I’ve never been to be honest (well except for that one time in 6th grade). Growing up, I was a really happy kid that did all sorts of activities just because I was curious and I wanted to. I also used to be an avid reader, but I think somewhere along the way, my entire world might have just shattered. Now, I don’t exactly know how to address that.

Also, I’m a violinist (I am really serious about it and pretty much practice every day). Recently, back in early June I think, I asked my mom why I can’t just go to a conservatory instead of med school. My mom and I rarely argue, but we both kind of blew up that night. For someone that wants to go to music school so bad, you’d think that they would be pretty much obsessed (in a healthy way ofc) with their instrument and practice all the time, whether they like to or not. But for some reason, even though I have so much desire to go to conservatory and have so much passion for the violin, I’m so
unmotivated ? (I know I said I practice every day, but it’s more because I have since I was young, so if I don’t practice it feels like something is missing from my day so I at least have to play a scale or something)
It feels like I want to pursue music because I love it with all my heart, but my body like refuses to be in sync with my heart.
I’m not quite sure how to describe it tbh.

I want to add that completing school assignments (especially virtually, god help me) that aren’t for like STEM classes gets really annoying/frustrating because my brain feels so damn foggy all the time. Whenever I see an open-ended question, my brain lowkey overloads and overthinks, and it feels like I can’t make any logical connections between ideas. This can happen on timed-writes too. Recently, I’ve also been accidentally missing so many zoom calls for school (and even a quiz yikes), and I used to never do stuff like this !! :(
It’d be one thing if I was sad all the time and having all of these physical symptoms, but I’m not sad all the time? And I know that’s not what depression is... it’s a lot more complex than that. It’s just that what I’m feeling doesn’t really feel like depression to me, if that makes any sense. This whole thing is also so frustrating because everyone thinks I’m some sort of perfect human that’s good at everything, but it really just feels like there’s constantly a hurricane in my brain (ok typing that out makes me feel really self-centered but oh well)
Yeah um anyways idk if you can tell, but I’m not the best at addressing and explaining my emotions/thoughts.

Is it possible that I actually do have depression or some kind of mental health issue? Do you guys have any other thoughts? Or advice? Anything is really appreciated, and if you read this whole thing, thank you &lt;3"

577,depression,Having anxiety attacks again,"Hi, well for the past few months, especially since the COVID situation started I was able to generally control my anxiety and stress levels, I became more active and I was finally stress-free. However, just a couple of weeks ago I moved to a new city, a new place with new people, and I've applied to a new high school.

I've lived in my previous city for the past 14 years of my life and I've only have lived out of that city only the first two years of my life right after I was born. After changing cities, I found myself rather comfortable at first and pleased with how smoothly the change came about, but I guess recently this sudden change really didn't work out for me.

I've noticed my anxiety being triggered again and I have been starting to have sudden bursts of attacks again due to the change in the education system, the complete difference of people I've met here, and the overall change of climate and location. I guess moving really doesn't sit right with me at the moment. I've found myself going to my old friends back in my previous city for a comfort zone, I completely seem out of touch and homesick and all I can think about is going back even though we just came here. Honestly speaking, I don't feel comfortable in the new school especially and I really miss thee old one.

What should I do?

TL;DR: I've recently moved from city to city and it's really affecting my stress and anxiety levels."
578,depression,Im 16 and I have to leave my house for 3 hours because it’s “Friday night“,My parents think I have a social life but because I havent been to school in six months I dont. I have no friends that I can hang out with because of Covid and I have no plans. Idfk where to go or what to do. Any suggestions. I have to be by myself.

I have so much shit going for me but I know I’m going to start fucking myself over and I can’t stop it.

I’m starting to not want to be here anymore and I hate to even say that :("
581,depression,Help with being numb.,"This will be long but I need help :(. Im emotionally numb and barely feel anything, yes I feel but BARELY, I know emotions are always there but it just FEELS like alot of it isnt. I want help I don’t know what to do. I messed up a relationship this is important because in the past because I was toxic but I loved being with them so much and I felt so much positive emotions. The reason I ruined it was because negative emotions started coming and I started bottling them up and I became very toxic even though it hurt seeing them cry because I bottled up my emotions. Everytime I do feel emotion even for a short period of time I fully cry for a while then its like they hit a wall and stops almost instantly. I don’t know what the source of the numbness, ill explain what I think they are hopefully ANY of you guys could help :(. #1 because I miss the times when I felt so much positive emotions, I know my memories don’t make up what was actually there because I know there were also bad times but my emotions were always there which felt good even if I was mad I still felt all of my emotions which I cherish because I loved feeling them, now I just cant for some reason which is why I look back at those memories, everytime I think about how great it was my eyes start to water sometimes a tear or 2 but never completely cry. #2 because I regret the things I did that were toxic and hate how because of that, things are completely gone because of me when I could’ve been living my dream with them right now, I feel like they were the best person I could’ve/ could be in a relationship with and I let them go, they were perfect physically and mentally but there was one problem I decide to keep personal, which made me bottle up my emotions and ruin everything, yes I could potentially meet someone as good as them but they were perfect for me and had everything I want in a person and hate the fact that ill never potentially ever meet anyone like that who’ll love me the same, and knowing that I hate how I let that go. #3 regret how I made them cry and sad when they made me feel so safe happy and loved every single moment with them when I felt all my emotions, because when I did feel emotion perfectly fine every time with them felt so cherished and like I was living in the moment, and knowing I made someone like that cry who loved me deeply feels sad. How am I supposed to know which one of these is the source of my numbness. What do you think is causing me to feel numb. When ever I feel a spark of emotion it 
Intrigues me to seek more of that emotion so I could finally cry and let go of this, but when I think that then my mind makes it seem like a chore and makes me lose the motivation to continue and plus it feels forced when I try doing seeking it. If it is anything else than what could it be im confused. I dont want any medication I want to be better. I can re-wind these problems in my head mentally but emotionally its like its not there. If I am running away from these problems what can I do to face them properly if its not that what other help should I get. Help"
582,depression,Depression snuck up on me again.,"I think it's snuck up in the past month or two. I used to enjoy work, and now I'm really not. I honestly will cry at the thought of going to work. It doesn't help that my manager has been snapping at me, and favoritism means that others get better things there. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough.

There's just so much going on, and it's so stressful.  Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I don't even have time to start a new hobby because working full time takes all my energy. 

Honestly, I just needed to get that off my chest. I'll tell someone I'm depressed, but they don't really take it seriously. I've gotten too good at acting fine."
583,depression,I can't be alone,"Every single time I get alone, even if it's just 5 minuts I start to think starting the plan to commit suicide. Should I cut my wrists? Should I take all the pills I could find? 
It's so damn exhausting cause there's days where I just don't have the courage or the guts to do it so it's just another thought lingering."
584,depression,Is depression like addiction in how you can’t get out of it until you truly want to?,I’m struggling with both right now sort of and I realized that I don’t know if I really want to get better. I kind of like wallowing in my misery and feeling sorry for myself to an extent. Even though I hate myself for not even trying to control my bad habits and never trying to do things that will improve my mood in healthy ways. What the fuck is wrong with me. I can’t stop ruining my life and the worst part is I’m the one doing it.
585,depression,I don't plan to make it to 15,"I'm a 13 and trans, I won't come out because I know my parents think I'm to young to know anything about myself. My parents have told me things I don't think parents would typically say to their children, for example ""you belong to until your 18"" or ""get off your ass and contribute to the house, you live here too so act like it."" That's not even half of it. I just hate my life and the people in it. What sucks more is I'm probably just over reacting and have a perfectly normal life and have a healthy relationship with my parents, like maybe it's normal for your home to be a dictatorship and you get no opinion or say in what happens."
586,depression,Feeling trapped yet again,"I'm stressed because I'm not connecting with anyone in my life, but somehow in my head the solution is to run and hide away from everything. Just dragging through my days, desperately hoping no one will talk to me yet wanting to feel loved simultaneously.

Everyone is either a liar, obnoxious, drab or stuck up... apparently there's no one *worthy* of me... right? Cuz *that's* how it works... pff good lord I'm an asshole

Maybe I'm so tired because I'm constantly hiding who I am from everyone. It feels like I'm always holding back from saying what I really want to say, but I know if I do decided to speak my mind I'm going to lose what I have. No one here cares when I say anything anyway. Tiny, stupid and useless. If that's not how I'm being seen then I just have absolutely zero understanding of what's going on.

Should I move away? I've lived in the U.S. since I was 2 or 3, and I'm currently 22 (originally from Canada). I was thinking maybe Australia or Japan or something... just not here... 20 years and I still can't find any real connections. I don't know whether moving somewhere else will change how willing I am to be open with others. Every day here is such a painfully fevered nightmare and I just can't keep doing this."

589,depression,The Most Painful Experience Ever,"I have never posted on here, but I really need someone to share this experience with, today, I almost killed myself. I was driving my car and the depression just hit me out of nowhere, I pulled into a gas station, I cried for about an hour, and not just sad crying, no this was something I have never experienced before. I decided to call the person who was on my mind, we have a complex past but I just needed someone to come and hug me, or tell me it was gonna be ok. This is how the conversation went. I am Me, he will be (MF) my friend.

Me; hey

MF; Hi who is this

Me; do you have a second to talk

MF; Yea babe I'm here for you what's up

Me (through tears) ; You don't know who this is do you? It's (my name)

He hung up.

It crushed me. It was the most pure form of rejection. The rejection meant that even if I decided that I didn't want to exist anymore that he wouldn't care, that my life meant nothing. I'm still very young (17F) he is older (21M) and I just needed someone to talk to. I drove myself to an overpass after that, and I seriously considered and thought about the suggestion that I may want to end my life. Maybe I sound dramatic but it was just the last push, it sent me into a break down. But I know life has more, it just doesn't feel like that right now. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this. please."

It is literally a struggle for me to actually laugh at anything aloud. I can't remember the last time I've actually belly-laughed. Someone will say something funny, and I'll have to stop and think to myself ""is this funny enough to laugh out out loud?"". Although, i do think some things are hilarious, I'll just ""laugh"" in my head, to myself. 

Yes, I haven't really cried or had major anxiety for several years, but would I rather have no ""real"" feelings or have the normal ups and downs a person has? Obviously only i can answer that question, but I'd like to hear an external opinion."

598,depression,Hello! Is it bad that i’m excited to start taking antidepressants?,"
I’m a 17 year old teen and have been pretty depressed for about 2 and a half years. About a year ago I spoke up and started therapy and since then I’ve been to three therapists—with the third and current one finally listening to my requests of getting meds and prescribing me zoloft. Obviously, my mom had to approve since I’m a minor and all, and was uncomfortable at my excitement which was shared by the rest of my family. They say I shouldn’t be so hopeful for medication and that it isn’t a holy grail. I know logically it’s not, but I’m so hopeless and tired of feeling so terrible all the time, I’ve tried so many vitamins and supplements and exercise remedies and I just want something to make me feel better for longer than two weeks.

Is it bad to want antidepressants? Am I being close minded for wanting them? A part of me wants them to cure everything but I know I’ll have to step up and start exercising and eating right again, but I’m hoping medication can give me the push to get out of bed and to just want things in life again. Is that even how antidepressants work?"
599,depression,I came back unrecognizable,"Tl;dr at the bottom 
I made the decision to drop out of college in January. Don’t know if I’ll go back. I wasn’t exactly the optimist before I left for school last fall, but I was no where near contemplating suicide on the daily. 
Something at school triggered something inside of me I never thought could possibly be there. By October, I was caught up in multiple vices and mindlessly following one of the most toxic people I’ve ever met under the guise of friendship. I was acting so different from my high school self. By December, I had slipped into “psychosis” as a result of anxiety and depression that just kind of snuck up on me. When I came home for winter break, my friends and family told me I seemed like a different person. 
I was more nervous than excited, like my college friends were, to go back for the second semester. I plunged deeper into psychosis, actively trying to protect myself from my classmates that I thought wanted to hurt me, hearing and seeing things, and not sleeping or eating. Over the almost-month I spent after winter break, I thought about how my loved ones saw me and it frightened me to go back home, but I didn’t want to be at school. 
Eventually, I gave in and agreed to let my mom bring me back home. It felt like a rescue mission. We both cried the whole way home. But something hasn’t felt right still, even after leaving school. My family still looks at me with different eyes than they had before, and even my boyfriend has gotten distant, citing that I’ve changed too much for the worse. Something is still inside me, and I’m afraid it’ll never leave now. I wish I never went to school. 
Tl;dr Going to college completely changed my personality for the worse due to suddenly becoming depressed, and I’m afraid I’m permanently changed now."
600,depression,Trigger warning: Selfharm and Suicidal ideation!,"I have depression (yes diagnosed), i got suicidal ideation which put me in an inpatient program. So i've been very active in the depression spectrum of things especially with some friends who had been diagnosed. 

i have been avoiding triggers and trying to get better even tho i still feel absolutely useless and that i shouldn't be getting better, besides that i don't self harm (SH). i know self harm doesn't equal suicidal ideation, self harm is an unhealthy coping mechanism that i luckily don't have, however the pressure of having depression and not self harming (as it is so prevalent) makes me just get worse and worse.

i keep thinking ""wow i don't deserve this because i don't self harm which means i'm not as bad as others and i am being selfish"" it hurts so much and every time i see someone talk about SH it triggers my suicidal thoughts and depression and it sucks, so i kinda wanted comfort in a way so that i know just because i don't self harm still means i have this mental illness i dunno. 

(I know i need to avoid all these ppl talking about SH or it'll just make me worse.)"
601,depression,Feeling extremely sad over not getting a job,"Hello.

I’m currently a second year Accounting and Finance student. 
I finished my second year with a 2.1 grade, the second highest possible grade ratio in the UK. My course offers me the opportunity to take part in a placement year, a year-long paid internship where I would gain hands on experience and essentially see what my life would look like after graduation. And this is where my problem is. 

I applied to over 60 places since February and got one phone interview. Every other place either responded with a rejection or I didn’t get any answer whatsoever. Because of this I got majorly sad. I can’t sleep, I stopped going to my bullshit job at a warehouse, I’m just tired of everything. I don’t think I will physically last working at night and going to university during the day.

I have one more opportunity coming up but the lady I was supposed to speak with is still on holiday and I’m freaking out a bit.

And I am so pathetically grateful when anyone is nice to me that it disgusts me. It almost makes me look down on them for not realising that I'm not worth it. 
I don't know this is just words I don't have a question or a story or anything. I'm just exhausted by the endless cycle of thinking maybe things could be better but nothing ever is, I am always the same."

604,depression,Everything I thought would fix my depression hasn’t,I thought getting my drivers license would . I thought getting a good job would . I thought finally finding a girlfriend to love would . And none of it has . I still am sad most days and I still feel suicidal and lonely despite adding more people into my life
605,depression,I had a dream I overdoesed and woke up disappointed I wasn’t dead,"I’ll keep this short and sweet, I had a really vivid dream that I was given a bottle of pills labelled (lethal one will kill you) and in the dream I took several after the first one didn’t work. I woke up and cried not only because I was still alive but even my subconscious wants the same. 

I’ve struggled with depression for years, I feel like there’s other issues there that I just haven’t been diagnosed for. I can’t afford therapy. My parents never  tried to get me help when I told them I need it. I was overreacting. They’re kicking me out because I’ve brought down the vibe of the house. I cut my friends out of my life because I feel like a burden.

My final two years of school were hardship, teachers on my back because I wasn’t turning up or paying attention, having anxiety attacks in the bathrooms. I’ve sabotaged the chances of me going to college and getting a good job because I can’t get a degree.

I have gone about committing multiple times with a cord in my hands when no one is home. Bottles of pills, but the only thing stopping me is the thoughts of my younger brother finding me. 

I want to go missing get a plane ticket and just drink myself stupid on a beach and drown myself I feel like that’s the best route for me.

I seen a video pop up on tik tok of a girl singing dancing in the sky at a girls funeral and I got really emotional not because of the funeral because I didn’t know the girl but because of the crowd of people my age knowing I haven’t and couldn’t make connections with a fraction of the people there."
606,depression,I realized something,"Today i realized that the things that make me atleast happy was just a distraction to the fact that im always really sad and lonely, that eventually the happiness will end and ill be back to my usual shitty self."
607,depression,Constant failure,"I feel like lately I am screwing things up left and right with someone really close to me. I make decisions that don't take his needs into consideration and I don't think I'm capable of being better. I feel like a C minus of a human being with no hope of ever improving.

Everything is hard and I just don't want to deal with it anymore. I want to give up and not feel sadness or pain or self disappointment or like I'm struggling anymore. I nearly drowned last year and life kinda feels like that."
608,depression,I don’t want to grow up but that’s inevitable and I’m scared,"Soo this may sound wired but I’m 14 years old and yesterday I saw a video that I remembered from my childhood and saw it was posted 8 years Ago... damm I started to think how many things have happened since those 8 years and the thought of growing up is scaring me more by the day. I feel I have to do something productive  ,I feel stressed by the fact of doing nothing, that I’m wasting my life , I DON’T WANT TO GROW UP and I know it’s inevitable, but just thinking that I’m going to become another cog in the murder machine (society) scares me to the bone , that I’m not gonna leave a mark on this world after I die, I’m in a constant state of paranoia and I want this to end but don’t know how to do it , it’s driving me crazy!!!."
609,depression,Prescribed medication advice,"Has anyone taken or taking Venlafaxine and Lamotrigine? 

My doctor prescribed it to me yesterday for my C-PTSD, Bi-polar and depression. 

Today was my first time taking them, I ate like it said before taking them then carried on getting ready to go get food then about as I’m just about to leave I had this feeling like I was going to die come over me I started sweating and shaking. I sat on my bed and had to run for the toilet I had poop and then I started projectile vomiting everywhere. 
I am so scared to take these pills again it took me 4 hours to sort my self out and I’m not even 100% now. 


Sorry I’ve never really posted before and not sure about layouts.

610,depression,Contemplating life,"My dad (91) died in June.  I'm very OK with that, as weird as that is to say.  However it has brought something to mind.

What is the point in living?

I mean, right now I feel like I'm living for other people.  I support my immediate family in my household, and I'm generally good with that.  But I feel like everything I'm actually doing is solely to put money in somebody else's pocket somewhere.  Like, yes I'm getting paid, but someone else is making money from me being hitched up to this yoke.

(This is not about money.  It's just the handiest, most relatable allegory I can muster).

Yes, I am going through a low point right now.  Yet, the question persists.

My dad was essentially able to support himself through retirement, right up until the end.  When the money ran out (his medical bills went waaaay up in the last few years of his life as his health took a nasty decline), he died.  It was almost to the dollar, like his retirement accounts were like his life-bar in a video game.

It can't all be about the money, can it?

Sorry, this is more rant than story..."
611,depression,College caused depression?,"So recently I just moved into college with a brand new everything. 0 of my high school friends came to this school and I have had a really hard time making friends. I just sit in my room and stare at my phone all day literally just thinking about how better off it would be if I just wasn’t here. Also I recently gave up vaping of 4 years and that may have contributed. I also feel like I just lost all my social skills I can barely talk to my roommate who just moved in with me it has been extremely awkward. I have been thinking about picking up vaping again even though towards the end of my days of vaping it was harder to breath, I feel like I won’t be able to do this without it. I really need advice from someone I just don’t feel like going on anymore. I just need someone in similar situation to tell me it gets better. I also recently gave up my girlfriend due to college it just feels like I have nothing anymore."
612,depression,I've started writing my suicide note,"Over the last 3 months my life has collapsed and I feel like I can't take more. I've been sad for as far as I can remember, probably 20 years now. I've spent so much time and effort and energy trying to ""fix"" whatever I identified as the reason for my sadness and anxiety at that particular moment in time, hoping and believing that there is happiness at the end of the tunnel and the grind.

I know what's wrong with me and that's me. A few weeks ago I was made to realize that there are very good chances I'll be hit with another failure in the next few days, in an aspect of my life that has tortured me for years and years and is probably the most painful thing in my life. I was very tardily diagnosed with ADHD and as such my academic career has been a disaster up until I started medication. I managed to salvage my bachelor's in psychology with very good grades good grades in the semester, especially considering I was going through the loss of a 5 year long relationship and was basically couchsurfing for a time before my exams. 

I finally had success in my academic life, for the first time in my life I hadn't barely scraped through but actually did well. At 27. I finally could start honestly thinking ""I'm not a fucking moron deep down, it's actually not all my fault that I've failed so much"". That was such an intense relief that I felt confident in facing the end of my relationship and of a lot of plans that mean that I'm really fucking alone right now, but I felt that I could take it, I'd resolved such an insanely intense source of pain by working with my therapist and with my meds etc, I felt so relieved. Because I thought I would be able to go on and get into the Master's and go on to do what I know I want to do and what I know I'd excel at, especially now that I can actually use my brain.

But chances are my candidacy to master's programs where I am will be declined. And I'll find myself with still nothing. And this time I can't take it, I don't have the resilience for it anymore. I know that I can apply next year, stuff like that that I've discussed with my Dr and therapist and family and whatever. I know that objectively I'm young and this isn't it. I know I could do it, I know I have the intelligence to excel and I could find alternatives that maybe take an extra year or whatever.

I just don't want to. I'm so tired of being sad and in pain. The prospect of being anxious and depressed for another year before maybe getting in somewhere just... I can't do it anymore. I just need it to stop. And the whiplash of feeling good for once about this feeling like I could finally gasp and breathe only to drown again worst than ever before... It needs to stop.

And I know that what I want to do is selfish and will cause pain and anger and sadness. That held me back in my thoughts so many times before. This time it's not enough. Once I get confirmation that I'm not getting into a master's degree I think I'll actually go through with it. I've got most of what I need, to make it as painless as I can, my letter doesn't put blame on anyone and acknowledges the pain and sadness I will cause. But I can't take anymore feeling alone when I'm surrounded, unloved when I am loved. It's too painful and I've let that pain bleed onto other people that have suffered so much because of me. 

I just need it to stop."
613,depression,School is slowly killing me,"
Hello kind redditors! As you may know, we recently had the 5 month lockdown and most UK kids are going back in about a week. Despite my Nan dying, these 5 months have been the best of my life simply because I didn’t have to worry about the stress of school. I didn’t have to worry about early nights and mornings I didn’t have to worry about what lessons I had and my homework. Nothing. However, as soon as the summer holidays started I have cried myself to sleep nearly every single day because of school and recently I couldn’t sleep all night because I just don’t want to go back. Being able to learn online and at the comfort of your own home has changed my life but I honestly don’t feel like I would make it through the school year. Any help would be appreciated.

Ps. We have received notice recently on what’s happening in response to covid. No AstroTurf or PE the only 2 things I partially like. :("
614,depression,"These days, I'm pretty certain that my emotions don't actually matter.","That's a harsh thing to read, but let me explain.

I've been treated for depression for 20+ years to differing degrees of effectiveness.  Medications and therapy (for a while), and the fixes wax and wane in their effectiveness, prompting a change periodically.

Through it all, one thing has become clear.  My emotions are not important to my treatment.  They are the symptom, not the cause.  They are the indicator, not the functional reason for it.

Yes, I feel the emotions, but they essentially give me nothing but problems.  They are an embellishment on my actual problem, and they are almost never helpful.  I've talked to counselors (etc.) about how I feel, and it has done absolutely nothing for me.  Well, nearly nothing...I did gain a few insights about depression in general, but nothing I wouldn't have learned from another source eventually.

(By emotions, I mean the negative ones, by the way.  I'll take the rare, good ones.  Had to clarify.)

So what is important?  

Action.  Taking action to make changes is the critical piece here, even if it doesn't feel quite right at this exact moment.  But, of course, this is the hardest part for those of us who are depressed.  Getting any momentum toward a goal is a monumental undertaking, but you need to do it.

&lt;/soapbox&gt;"
615,depression,Life is so meaningless.,What is the point of all our efforts in life if we are all going to die at the end of the day? Are you not afraid of death at all? I am very afraid lately although I am 19 years old.
616,depression,Depression is like a subscription service I never signed up for,"Hey man, that’ll be $30 a month minimum for the rest of your life or, uhh, you’ll want to kill your self. Deal?"
617,depression,I'm a bad friend,"I keep on being too open until a friend of mine doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I feel bad, it makes me feel I'm obnoxious. I want advice how i handle this situation, and how to make amends with my friend."
618,depression,I think I've reached the next level.,"Usually when I'm feeling depressed I end up just laying in bed listening to sad music. Nothing else. But today, I won't get into detail but I had a small disagreement with my best friend. Afterward, I sat in silence for a while and since the argument I've been feeling very weighed down to the point that I have to roll myself off my bed because I don't even have the energy to sit up. I've also been feeling incredibly nauseous since the argument and it consistently feels like I'm about to throw up.  Nothing is helping and I don't know what to do with myself."
619,depression,I feel extremely guilty,"I deal with crippling depression and anxiety and unfortunately those around me have to deal with me and i feel like shit about it. Ive been going through a particularly horrid depressive episode recently because my cat has gone missing and my stepdad has to deal with my isolation and constantly anxiously talking about where my cat could be, whats more ive also had suicidal thoughts because school is coming up soon and i was supposed to go to college but I failed the test to get in plus i failed three classes this previous semester due to severe depression and i know if i go into school depressed again i will have another repeat. But i dont want to die because I would make my stepdad and my friends feel like they didn’t do enough to make me feel better which absolutely is not true and i just feel so guilty about even feeling like this and having thoughts. Idk this is just a rant because my therapists office isn’t picking up and idk how else to get this off my chest."
620,depression,Feeling discouraged about life and the fact that nobody seems to think I deserve one.,"I’m feeling discouraged about how life is going because of the pandemic. I’m 22, I just graduated and I’m back living at home. Which is fine and everything, but it feels like this pandemic is never going to end. Jobs were already hard to find for recent graduates before the pandemic, but now things are even worse. I’m single and jobless, and I just feel like things are never going to change. I’m helping my parents out with whatever they need, but nothing fun or exciting is happening in my life right now. I’ve read reddit posts where people are still managing to find jobs and get into relationships despite the pandemic. 

To top it off, my parents friends have children a few years older than me. One of them recently got engaged and the other found a high paying job and got to move to San Francisco (somewhere fun for a young person to live). My mom was talking to their mom (let’s call her Brenda), and when she got off the phone she looked upset. I asked my mom what was wrong, and apparently their conversation went like this:

My mom: I’m happy for your kids! That’s great news. I can’t wait until Ella (me) finds gets a job and finds a boyfriend.

Brenda: Oh well, things are different for your family. Your husband is on disability and you’re making such little money. Ella should stay home with you guys as long as she can to take care of you and your husband. 

My mom and I are upset for the same reason. So her kids can have a job and get married,  and flourish and thrive in life... but I shouldn’t? Yes, it’s true my dad can’t work anymore. And my mom is a teacher so she doesn’t make a ton of money. And I’m an only child, so all this falls on me. But ever since all my parent’s friends found out I was majoring in finance/accounting, they’ve always said similar things as Brenda. One of her friends even insinuated that whatever money I earn should go straight to them. She said something to my parents like, “Oh once Ella graduates and starts making money, all your money problems will be over - accountants make tons of money” They all act like I should be attached to my parents hip and take care of them for the rest of my life. No life for Ella! Just take care of my parents for the rest of my life. 

I know that sounds selfish, but I want a life and a family of my own. I’m just discouraged because it feels like this pandemic isn’t going to ever be over and life is never going to change."
621,depression,"Turn For the Worse, I Can't Stand Living Anymore Because of My Teeth","I had been doing quite well this year: I got a promotion, lost a bunch of weight and began taking charge of my health, improved my dental hygiene, finally signed up for classes again, started therapy. I felt pretty good most of the time, this was by far my year of accomplishment.

Last week I had my third dental set back that month. My new dentist basically told me I will need 10k worth of crowns on top of my 4k implant, and that all my teeth are falling apart despite my much better practices (perhaps I just have bad saliva?) All of the money we saved for an engagement ring and wedding, gone with a few words. Many more incredibly painful procedures in my near future. All of that and I probably won't have a full set of teeth in 10 years, at which time it'll probably be a 50k fee for full dental implants that make speech difficult and involve tearing all my teeth out. If I make it that long.

This week was supposed to be my vacation/staycation with my fiancee. I haven't gotten out of bed in 3 days and I haven't really been able to eat in 4 or 5. I've never actually had the loss of appetite before- I LOVE food. I can't seem to bring myself to eat more than a couple bites though. I have been pushing my fiancee away as I feel he can do better. I'm thinking about dropping the classes- if I ever want a chance to go back to school I MUST do well, and I don't think I can with how I feel.

Any advice is welcome."
622,depression,I really want a hug because I’m so touched starved but my trauma is preventing me from asking anyone for one,"A lot of people here talk about how they just want a hug, so virtual hugs to all of you. Especially with corona, hugs are few and far between, and even if you get one, it’s that awkward side hug that doesn’t really count. I’m single and have never been in a relationship (I’m 16 so I still have time), but everyone around me seems to be in a relationship, or has already been in one. It’s not that I’m in a rush to date anyone, but I just feel so alone, and while I could ask someone out, I don’t want to because I can’t deal with people touching me. I flinch when someone brushes against me in the hallways and I have to brace myself for handshakes. I don’t even know what happened to me to have caused this, but it’s been preventing me from seeking out any kind of physical contact, which leaves me with these feelings of hopelessness. I don’t really know where I’m going with this but maybe someone can relate to it."
623,depression,A horrifying wake up call today,"This is my first post here. I’m sorry if I’m breaking the rules, but I just needed to vent. If there’s a better subreddit, let me know. I’ve been battling depression, and suicidal thoughts for the last 20+ years. This morning, I found out that the mother of one of my best friends took her life yesterday after a long battle with depression.

I’ve known her for 12+ years. She wasn’t really a second mother to me, but she was one of the sweetest, most selfless persons I’ve ever known. I don’t know where I’m going with this, I’m just devastated. As someone who has considered ending things, and is now experiencing the aftermath of someone who did, I’m begging you to reconsider anything drastic you may be thinking.

The people you leave behind will be gutted, and wondering what they could have done differently. Stay safe, be well, talk to someone."
624,depression,I believe my wife is why my depression is not improving over the last couple years and the very thought makes me want to die.,"I have a lot of baggage and don't even know where to begin. I suffered significant child abuse and then military sexual trauma when I finally thought I had escaped the abuse. I am a very broken person. 

I have been married for over 10 years and my wife has supported me but I feel like she doesn't actually want to connect with me. She stays and she will listen but when I try to share any of my interests or get her to even just sit and watch a show I am interested in she doesn't try.

I try to watch some of her shows but anything with surgery or medical stuff is just something I can't stomach and she watches that 90% of the time. I have told her this and she still puts it on all the time and complains when I don't sit with her. It literally makes me sick to watch it. I'll stick around when she puts cooking shows on but that isn't all that often.

I love D&amp;D, video games and animes. I tried to get her to try D&amp;D or any video games and she refuses to try, period. Minecraft, shooters, super smash brothers, racing games. All of it. When I try to share any of my shows at all so that at least we can watch a little of what she like and a little of what i like she shoots it down as well.

I started watching RWBY again and I thought maybe she might like it. So I showed her just one of the trailers and she just goes, ""what made you think I would even be interested in watching this at all? Its stupid."" I showed a lot of enthusiasm for it and she crapped all over it.

In the end I feel like we don't connect at all anymore. And i feel completely alone at times and part of me blames her. But because she helped me get through some tough things I feel like its just wrong to blame her at all. The very thought of it feels like betraying her and it makes me want to die so she can be free of me.

I don't think I have the strength to leave her and live my life. I would rather kill myself than do it and all I want is to just have someone to sit next to while I watch an episode of my shows once in a while. 

I know Im pathetic and a total joke but what am I supposed to do now?"
625,depression,Why do I keep waking up to just deal with more bad things the next day,"Quarantine has been fucking terrible. I lost my jobs and got denied unemployment. Ok, fine. I’m resilient. Let’s keep trying. I’ve gotten through more difficult things. 

Bills keep coming and private student loan debt is a thing. Alright, fine. Just keep trying. You’ll get yourself out of it. 

I live with my parents and I have had a terrible relationship with them. They don’t see me as enough. They’ve told me they wanted to abort me. They never wanted me in the first place. Reminded of that every day. It’s fine, just keep going. 

I’ve been separated from my partner due to the quarantine as we are in different countries. I feel so lonely without them. But it’s ok, just keep trying. 

I lost interest in my hobbies and exercising. I stopped eating. 

I’ve been struggling with my mental health for most of my life. I hate my body. I hate my skin. I hate myself. 

Few months go by, find out both my parents have cancer. It gets worse by the week. My dad is showing signs of it spreading to his brain. He’s crazy shit. It terrifies me. I don’t know how to feel about it all because they don’t fucking love me but they’re still my parents. It’s ok, stay strong. Keep trying. 

My car just broke down for the 3rd time over quarantine. It’s getting towed. I feel like I’m at my tipping point. 


I tried to commit suicide a month ago. I was so fed up. And since then, I tried to get better. I got in anti depressants, started looking for therapy, but every week things just get worse. I don’t want to wake up the next day. I don’t want to fucking do this all over again. I don’t want to be kicked back down to my knees. Everyone just keeps saying “just keep trying” or “you can do this” but, I really don’t think I can. It’s too much."
626,depression,Is this depression? Not sure because I have never been to a therapist/psychiatrist.,"Lately I've been recognizing this familiar pattern of behavior  of mine and I can't say that it's going downhill again. I haven't been feeling any sense of emotions like gratitude, empath, care/concern, happiness. All I can recognize is that I'm becoming numb. I react and interact less again to situations that may or may not involve me and it's been harder for me to find my will to get up from bed every day. Like I am not this lazy but now I would rather prefer to just lay in bed awake doing nothing than to interact and speak to people. I also lost my sleeping pattern, I now either sleep for two hours or 16 hours. I also eat only a meal in two days,I just don't feel the hunger. And my burst of emotions only hit me when I'm about to sleep. So most of the nights I'd cry myself to sleep BUT I don't really know the reason why. I just want to cry so hard because my heart feels heavy (again, idk why). When I wake up in the morning, it's all back to being numb again like it has become my cycle for about THREE MONTHS already.

I still normally talk to my friends but lately I have really been avoiding people that aren't really close to me. I deactivated 4/7 of my social media accounts wanting to isolate myself for no apparent reason, people talking and other distractions just simply annoy me so easily. And I was never really like this. Not for quite a long time.

None of my friends know about this because I don't want to be a burdensome to them so this is the very first time I am opening up about this.

P.s. Yes, I have never seen a therapist/psychiatrist to be actually diagnosed with depression that's why I'm not really sure if this is really one."
627,depression,Hormones=depression,"(32F) I have a suspicion that hormones cause a lot of my depression. I asked my doctor about this and he said it’s impossible to know if there’s a hormone imbalance until I’m out of childbearing years. Has anyone been able to successfully find a hormone imbalance was causing your depression? If so, how were you tested and treated?"
628,depression,depression is one of the worst diseases.,it drains you physically and mentally. it makes you not want to do anything. it can make you take your own life. it can destroy relationships. it can break you down repeatedly. i dont want to feel this way anymore... its causing physical pain in my chest... it wont stop...
629,depression,Depression &amp; Obsession,"I have recently found myself sinking deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of obsessive thinking. In general, I have been feeling darker. I have spent probably 10 or so hours in the last couple days examining a photo scouring the internet for its origins because I thought it could have been someone I knew. When my medicine starts to wear off, I can't move on or let things go. Everything seems normal until my medicine starts to work again after taking it, and then I see how differently I was thinking. But I am starting to wonder how important thinking ""normally"" is.

I have been taking pills and going to therapists for too damn long. Five or six years at this point. And I have never had a medicine that I felt ""worked."" I have just realized that the reason I didn't like my medicines in the past wasn't because they didn't help my depression, although that might also have been true. I hated how cloudy my mind became. I couldn't tell how I felt. Ever. Being so empty and slow all the time was awful, even if I looked better on the outside. The moments I enjoy most are the ones full of feeling. A deep sadness can at least mean something; being empty or restrained is awful. And when I feel good, I swear the world changes. Colors are deeper, songs make me gasp for air, I finally see the potential in the people and things around me. 

I think I want to give up on medicine again. Being depressed is painful as hell, but even then I have passion. These pills just hide my feelings from me and leave me bored.

TL;DR: Medicine is making me passionless, this post is not actually about XXXTentacion."

631,depression,"Don't be too hard on yourself, especially at present. Accept that there is now a new way of life because of COVID.","Look, I know all about that nagging feeling that you're a failure, and you're not doing anything, and you're *lazy.* I know that, yes, lethargy may be common amongst us. Negative thinking too.

But honestly, you're doing the best you can. We all are. I promise. 

Put into perspective the fuckery that is actually going on worldwide, and realise that just because you stayed rolled up in bed all-day and binge-watched Netflix - **doesn't mean you are a failure**. In the grand scheme of it, your actions right now are excusable. This is a key entry in the history book of the world and will be known for a long time. Unprecedented. It blows my mind thinking about this.

For some reason, I thought, (becoming aware of my depression and how my life has changed with it) that my depression would be gone quickly, in time, and ready for the next big change in my life. But no, the harsh reality is that this black dog is with me for a while now, and **that is how it is**.

I've moved into my 2nd year uni housing and am now waiting for the 2nd year to start. Depression is very much present. Yes, I've moved in and am now preparing for uni, but no, the old 'normal' life isn't a thing anymore, therefore the unrealistic expectation I had of me being without depression, **is not how the story is panning out**. And to live and compare yourself to what you would be like without depression is painful and not helpful. Be easier on yourself.  

Don't do things because of depression -&gt; depression about not doing things -&gt; but don't do things because of depression. Infinite cycle. 

I made the mistake for a while now of thinking that I am useless or lazy because I'm not doing 'normal life' things that you **would** be doing **IF** a global pandemic wasn't happening and things were 'normal'. 

TLDR; You are not lazy, you are loved. Don't beat yourself up, especially in these trying times. You got this. We all have."

633,depression,Scared to be okay again,"For some unknown reason im so scared of being okay again. It's like depression is who i am now if that makes any sense at all. 
I'm scared to seek help or take any medications or anything at all because there is a possibility that it can help me be better and that really terrifies me. 
It's really hard to explain but It's like my whole being is controlled by depression and without it im nothing. 
Can anyone relate to this or is it just me?"
634,depression,Meds,I’ve tried 4 different antidepressants and none of them helped idk if I should keep trying
635,depression,I don't think I have a chemical imbalance or even a mindset that can be cured.,"Every day I feel more hopeless, and I think I'm at the point where people who love me don't want / have the energy to try to help me anymore. 

I've kinda been pushing everyone away lately but I don't have the energy to try anymore.

I was supposed to graduate law school this last fall but couldn't get myself to finish one paper that I had to write. I moved back home because I have no money and have no idea how I can get back to NY to finish in the next year and a half.

I don't feel like I can get a job. A combination of feeling incompetent at basic things and not having the energy to fake being interested in things. I had an internship through school at the attorney general's office and quit early because it drained my soul and overwhelmed me so much.

But the thing is, the 'help' that I've received from people does not help me at all. Parents and friends have helped with my literal survival, but can't help me with my bigger problems. I've tried 3 antidepressants and literally can't feel any effect from them, positive or negative. Psychs and therapists are patronizing and try to cure me. But they don't really know me and the day-to-day piece of shit I am. They see Im in law school and think I just need to be medicated.

I don't think that will ever work for me because Im depressed about the way life is in general, and about my own real shortcomings. I have no hope that I can ever turn my life around and every day is just a reminder of how much I can't wait to die"
636,depression,Why I am depressed &amp; why I don't fit in modern society," I've been thinking a lot about my depression and i tried to figure out/pin point the biggest factors associated with it. I realized there are a lot of (external)  things that contribute to my mental illness. I'm almost sure my depression is not caused by a neuro-chemical imbalance, but I realized it has mainly to do with the impact of modern society, the way we live and all the chaos that is going on now.                              
The things is:  We are way too depended on money, too much revolves around work, we don't really have to rely on each other anymore and we live very individualized nowadays. which impacts our health, mainly because humans are evolved/ designed to live in groups and we used to depend and work together (for our survival) So humans used to be more connected to each other.   We are also heavily exposed to very dangerous toxins that are in the environment and even in our food, air/water pollution and we are disconnected from our food supply.   I think all these aforementioned things are strongly related to the rise in widespread mental illness, aside from other factors, of course.    There are also things that i do like about the modern industrialized world, but the cons largely outweigh the pros. 

Sometimes i think that depression is a normal response to all the adversity, and that it's normal to be depressed now....mainly because of the decaying state of society and the world."
637,depression,How can I talk to my dad about HIS depression?,I'm suspecting that my dad might be suffering from clinical depression. I don't think he knows what that is or maybe he knows but he is hiding or doesnt want to see a therapist. How do I talk to him about this?
638,depression,It's 4:30 am and I can't sleep,"I suffer from depression, social anxiety and agoraphobia, so it should be no surprise that I have no friends, girlfriend or social life. The agoraphobia is a real bastard as it means I almost never leave the house, I am stuck here on my own 24/7. I may leave the house only a few times a year for non-medical reasons. Normally my depression is kept somewhat in line with medication (it doesn't make me happy, it just keeps me off the ledge) but I will have bouts of extreme depression that can last for a day, a week or longer and it's that time again tonight. I've been laying in bed staring at the ceiling for hours, just thinking about how much I hate my life, and how lonely and empty it is. I know I will never get better without professional help, and I'm not getting it currently.

I'm so desperate I've been looking on [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) for events or groups I'd be interested in, but there's nothing close to me and I can't drive, and the agoraphobia makes it very difficult to stray too far from home anyway. In reality, my mental health problems would prevent me from going even if there was an event near me, but it felt better than staring at the ceiling.

I don't really know why I'm making this post, I guess I just need to vent. I'm going to take some more pills and hopefully fall asleep at some point soon."
639,depression,I wish I die in sleep.,Ah no...its never gonna happen
640,depression,I want a gf and stuff like other ppl,"Why do other ppl get girls all the time and I dont? 

Also, how do other ppl get friends and stuff and I dont?"
641,depression,"The misconception that ""we shouldn't feel this way""","When life hits us hard, many of us default our thinking to, “It shouldn’t be this way”, “I shouldn’t feel like this”, “Why is this hurting me so much?” “Other people get through their life situations, so I shouldn’t be hit this hard”.

It is okay for the shocks in our life to be above our adaptive range. It is okay if we feel like we can’t carry the burden, we can’t figure out how to feel better, or we don’t know where we can turn. That is okay. That is human. If the contrary were true and we were generally unphased by life’s personal events (which probably sounds real nice and peaceful right about now), we would have no grasp of our identity, no barometer for the happy moments, and life would fly by leaving us dead before we knew it.

The worst thing we can do is think that however we feel is not acceptable. Because it is. However you feel right now – you may have hate, jealousy, guilt, shame, fury, confusion, despair – it is normal. It is okay. Do not judge yourself for simply reacting to events that occur. If a lightning bolt, 100 yards in front of you, strikes the earth, your eyes will likely widen, your heart might skip a beat, and you may jump back a foot – or five. Would you judge yourself for this? Would you say, “gosh, why did I let my eyes open that far?”. No, you wouldn’t. You were naturally reacting to an event that occurred, so how can you look at yourself and say your reaction should be any different?

Lest we forget we are also human. By nature, we have strong feelings and emotions that kick up when strong events happen in our lives. This is all part of the shock factor and resisting a natural effect causes more tension and pain. Believing that you shouldn’t feel frustrated or sad or emotional invalidates your natural pain and attempts to close up a wound that hasn’t had a chance to heal. Have you ever shaken up a soda bottle and then opened the top only to have it start to explode but you quickly twist the top back on? Twisting the top back on that soda bottle is what you’re doing to yourself when you perpetuate the thinking that your feelings aren’t appropriate. Letting yourself unscrew that soda cap and releasing the effects of events around you will grant you healing opportunities to reach a place of calm and understanding. Let things out to let things in.

Many modern self-help advocates, including renowned shame researcher Brene Brown, promote “leaning in” to your struggle. It really is an effective way to process and stabilize after shock. Scream into a pillow, scream in the shower, meditate for an hour, cry, go to therapy, blast those song lyrics in your car. Whatever helps you accept, feel, and release your feelings will help you absorb the shock ramifications and better position you to understand and grow. 

So, don’t judge yourself for how you feel. Don’t judge yourself for the magnitude or depths at which you feel those feelings. You’re a human being, responding naturally to events in your environment. Let the waves crash over you, feel them, lean into them and offer your soul grace for whatever comes up."
643,depression,What's the Point of Living?,Why even fight? It's nothing but a struggle and there's no end. You always end worse off. I engraved my name in a bullet. I thought of peaky blinders lol. The only reason I haven't offed myself is because it'd make my mom sad.
644,depression,I feel like life is passing me by and I don't know what to do about it anymore,"I feel like I don't really belong anywhere and I don't really know what to do. I've always felt a little lonely growing up, but now its worse than ever, especially with this pandemic going on. I want a girlfriend but I can't seem to get one. I know people say that relationships don't solve problems and you gotta learn how to have fun and stuff on your own... I still feel like a relationship would definitely help. I've been getting alot into biking lately, doing 50km bike rides. At first the biking was helping but now I just feel extremely lonely whenever I'm biking. Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal or anything like that. I've been through alot of medical issues as a kid and I pushed past all of them and I ain't about to go waste my life now. I'd love to fall asleep in a girl's lap as they push their fingers through my hair and sing me a lullaby...Anyways I'm just rambling on now. Anybody have any suggestions?"
645,depression,Felling Stuck,"Lately life has been really hard for me when nothing is actually wrong. I have a good job, an amazing boyfriend, a couple really great friends, and school is starting soon. Yet here I am just unhappy and feeling stuck. I have no motivation for anything. I don’t want to do anything and what’s worse is that there’s nothing to do. Work is slow and school hasn’t started yet, so I have no obligations. 

I’ve explained this to my boyfriend and he tries his best to help, but everything he suggests just doesn’t spark anything. I’ve tried playing video games to pass the time and I get bored within minutes. I have no interest in starting new hobbies or revisiting old ones. I just feel stuck. 

This will probably pass once I’m busy again, but right now I feel miserable. Like I know everything will be fine, just right now it’s not. So here I am, stuck for a bit."
646,depression,student loan debt makes me want to off myself,"i’m $40000 down the hole for a degree i’m not even sure will get me a job, fuck this shit"
647,depression,Everyone who has ever helped me with anything wasted their time.,"My parents, every teacher and friend I've ever had, those firefighters who saved my life when I was 5, those paramedics who saved my life when I was 17, my best friend who has directly stopped 2 suicide attempts, all my co-workers at my various jobs who tried their best to be nice and show me the ropes of the job, what they all have in common is that they were wasting their time.

After 21 years of life, what do I have to show for it? I'm 220+ pounds, living off what's left of government aid money. My room is absolutely filthy, with a mountain of pizza boxes dominating one corner. I spend my time playing video games and overeating to distract me from the fact that I can't pull myself out of this rut that I've been in for the past 5 or so years. I get depressed, my life turns to shit, I get determined, I do something good for myself, and then I fall right back into my rut again a week later. I can't learn to shut up around people, and have been an asshole to so many friends without even realizing it until later.

Look at my sister. She had it worse than me. She was an accidental baby. My mom had her way before she met my dad, she didn't get to see her dad much (he's still a cool guy), and look at her. She has a stable job, lives with a close friend of hers, and she looks happy. I mean, I, of all people, should know looks aren't everything, but I honestly think she's generally happy with her life. She's had fuckups, sure, but she always seemed to bounce back. She's not perfect, but she's just so much better than me. 

Then you have me. I was the planned one. My parents did absolutely everything they could to give me a good life, and teach me how to be a good person. And I'm not going to say they did a bad job, in fact, I think they did a great job. I commonly look up to my father and think what he would do in this situation. But despite all their effort, I'm still just this fat blob of a man who has literally never kissed a girl who isn't related to him in his life. I held one job for two years, but other than that, I haven't been able to hold a job for more than 4 or 5 months.

Is this what natural selection is? Am I meant to die alone, to remove myself from the gene pool? There's no way my offspring would be any better than me. There's no way any woman would be happy with me. The only thing that makes me happy is that I'm not the worst person in the gene pool, and even that makes me sad because there are people worse than me reproducing, and I have to ask, *why?*

Am I part of some sick joke? Was I put here only to suffer? The only thing really keeping my going at this point anymore is that small, tiny faint hope. That slim, fishing-wire-thin hope that I'm clinging on to for dear life, that someday, somehow, I can change myself into a productive member of society, find a nice girl, marry her, have kids. And I can look down at my son/daughter, and I can think to myself ""I did it."" But who the fuck am I kidding? I know how this ends. After I finish writing this, I'm probably going to get really determined, go do something good, like workout, or apply for a job, then fall back into my rut again. And one day, one of these days, it's all going to end with my neck swinging from a rope.

But at the same time, death terrifies me. No matter what happens after death, no matter which religion (or lack thereof) is correct, my afterlife is going to be either just as bad, or worse than this life. I could go to hell. I could be reincarnated. Or I could just experience nothing, forever. All of those things terrify me, *especially* the last one. It's for that reason that I want to believe in a religion, but I just can't bring myself to. I cannot bring myself to believe in something that I can't just prove like that.

I don't even know why I'm typing this anymore. Am I crying out for help? Do I just need to get it off my chest? Is this my suicide note? I have no clue. I just want a better life. I want a life where I don't have to fight every inch of the way, just to be considered normal and healthy. Is that lazy? Sure. Why not. Call me lazy, I don't give a fuck anymore."
648,depression,Asking for advise,"It is hard to not get involved into toxic dynamics, like the incels who say they will always be alone just because, while at the same time feeling so alone and miserable, but trying not to blame everything on me being a fucking idiot because I'm really trying my best to become a better person.

649,depression,I have no morale compass. I feel like nothing. I'm becoming dangerous.,"I am such a weird person. And I can't help it. Everyone at my work thinks I'm insane/an incel. I have a personality for each person there and they're starting to pick up on it. Now I'm an asshole to everyone and I'm trying to isolate myself. The only reason there are people still trying to reach out to me is because I'm young (22). I look okay but I have a look that is guaranteed to age terribly and I'm going to be an old creepy man who will die alone a virgin. I am an extremely logical thinker, which is why I cannot believe in a God and I feel like everything is meaningless. But for some reason I'm also very emotional and my moodswings are violent and quick, but it's all bottled up inside me while I maintain a facade around others. I have stopped caring so much that on my first therapist appointment I upfront told my therapist I masturbated, smoked weed, and played video games every day. Even though I have stopped giving a fuck, for some reason I give a million fucks when socializing with others, trying my best to either avoid or please them."
650,depression,hearing about people together and being on my computer both individually make me feel infinite times worse,"i dont have anyone who really is close to me in my life besides my girlfriend. she is really really sweet and pretty good to me, but is it wrong for me to feel really really sad whenever she talks about her friends, because i dont think i have any? it is miserable. everything is miserable. i just sit here on my computer not sure what to play because a lot of games seem to be multiplayer or more enjoyable with friends, which i dont have any of :/

i just wanna play some games on the weekend with one or two people and thats it. i am not asking for much, but i dont know why i just am SO unlikeable by so many people. i hate my life. hopefully it is almost over."
651,depression,You know those people you meet and you just hate? You’re one of them.,"It’s a direct quote. I asked someone 9-10 years ago why they seemed to have a problem with me. That was their response. I had done nothing wrong to them. 

Now, whenever anyone is even remotely distant or standoffish, I immediately think about that. I know when she said that, it was from a place of malice and she’s probably just a terrible person. But what if it’s true? What if people just hate me? What if I’m just terrible and nobody knows why?"
652,depression,I'm about to just lose my shit,"I know that everyone is in the same position right now, but the isolation from social distancing, avoiding gatherings, and working remotely has me ready to crack. 

I have extreme anxiety and depression issues, which I had under control, and im lucky to have a family, but I straight up can't do this anymore. If I don't have a conversation with someone I'm not related to soon, I'm going to completely lose it. I've spent months actually talking with a groundhog FFS! 

I'm not a hugely social person, but it's too much. I tried talking to my husband, but he took it the wrong way. Which turned into a huge fight. It got turned into me somehow wanting to be a whore and party, and being yelled at for complaining about being isolated when he'd kill for the opportunity and him telling me im not actually social.

He doesn't get that every day is exactly the same—it's like I'm trapped in some weird Groundhog Day hell. Being eaten alive by snails would be more entertaining than being bored to death. I can't hack it. 

I'm bored and lonely. I'm feeling useless, worthless, and frustrated. I can't stand my own company. I find myself wondering what it would be like just to splatter my useless brain all over the wall. 

I just need to hear something new and have some form of interaction before I just walk in front of a bus."
653,depression,I’m sorry.,"

The following post is about to be the most pathetic thing you might’ve ever read on reddit. I’m sorry , just like I’m sorry for most things I’ve done in my sad ass life. 

I feel exhausted. I don’t know how to explain how exhausted I am , how disappointed I am every time I open my eyes in the mornings. It feels like ... being trapped in this never ending circle of despair , depression, deception and not being courageous enough to actually end it. 

I’m a (23F) , people say I’m extremely funny , that I have a cynical but refreshing sense of humor. People say that I am pretty fuck , they say I’m “ beautiful” , that I am smart , too mature for my own good. I know people like to have me around , as I make them smile, I listen to them , i feel them maybe too deeply as I’m overly empathetic. I guess I like to give what I can’t seem to have. 

But most times ... I don’t know if any of this is true , especially the physical part. I’ve been fighting the person standing in the mirror for as long as I can remember , I hate her and the fat on her thighs , I hate her and the way her face looks , I hate everything about this person as I feel like I’m standing at what failure looks like. I lost a lot of weight , although I was never excessively fat , my family  would pick on me since I was a kid because my cousins looked ... better. I’ve never had self confidence , I do fake it , but my insecurities are never too far away from me. When people compliment me on anything, all I hear , is lies and pity. It makes my life hard. Harder than it should be. 

I don’t know what I’m doing with my life , I used to dream , I used to be full of hope to make myself a better future far away from my toxic family , I used to believe love would happen to me too. That I would have a circle of friends , a clearly defined path ahead of me , I thought I would be someone, somewhere , doing something. Yet , here I am , haven’t showered in days and a heaviness comparable to the weight of a planet sitting on my chest. 

I feel like an imposter , my family and friends thinks I have my shit together , especially my mother. She always thought I was the smartest kid she’s ever seen , she has hope for me , lots of it. She thinks I’m a little genius , a wise , empathetic , loving daughter that makes her laugh. Truth be told , I just want to tell her how sorry I am , to be the walking disappointment I actually am. I don’t dream anymore , I have no will and it feels like everything I’ve been through in my life , is finally catching up on me. 

I have love buried deep down somewhere inside of me , I want to love , I want to be able to hug someone and feel something again. I can’t even do that anymore , I’m just numb, I don’t even know who I am anymore. My mom used to tell me things gets better “ one day” , is that day even coming or is that what people tell themselves to keep going? I have no strength or will left in me. 

I do not have a boyfriend , the last time I had one was so many years ago , I can’t even remember clearly. I’ve started seeing people , because the poetic side of myself is still clinging to that love I’ve been craving. I either attract bums , or end up with my heart shattered in pieces. And when this happens , my body is the one to pay the price , I think to myself “ maybe if you weren’t this ugly , this boring, this short or this fat ...”
Ffs , Right now I can’t even locate these pieces , I can’t even think of where they could be. Why can’t someone chose me just for once for fuck sake ? What am I doing wrong ? And why can’t I feel a thing for those who seem to have a slight interest in me ? It’s either I don’t feel attracted to them , or they only want to have sex with me, then throw me away like a post wanking tissue. I don’t want to ever be with someone out of options , I think we all deserve the purest form of love , am I just one of those people that can only contemplate it and not actually have it ? 

There’s a lot in here , but the last nights of crying have drained most of my words out. Thanks for those who read through this horrible pity party."
654,depression,My Suicide Note.,"From the brain of \[Me\]

This is my suicide note. If you are reading this, then I am dead or have attempted to end my life.

I am not happy being alive. I alone take the actions to end my life because I am tired of being in this awful world of injustice, fighting, hatred and suffering. I am tired of accepting what a disgusting world this is.

To be clear; *no one* is to blame for my death. It is clear to me that I am mentally incapable of dealing with the trials life brings us. I am in pain, and I don't see a way out besides ending my own life. I don't feel comfortable with who I am, what I'm doing with my career, or what I aspire to do. I reject a life of constant pain, fear and anxiety that I find myself constantly stuck in. This choice is mine to make and I make it to claim control of a life I have had very little control over.

I am sorry that this is what I felt I had to. 2020 has certainly been a rough year and my mental health has declined significantly. I have some certainty that I don't enjoy my life, purely because my mental health has always held me at a disadvantage and cuts short any chance I have of sustaining emotional bonds and being a proper friend and son. I don't feel mentally fit to continue given how badly I've coped with most events in my life ever since I was 13. I don't feel that facing a future of uncertainty, stress, deadlines and exams will be good for my health, however its the only choice given and I reject to as to not prolong the inevtiable. 

Again, *no one* should feel guilty for my death; no one is to blame, and never will be. Everyone should be able to live their lives, do the things they want to do and succeed, not worry about me.

I have tried very hard throughout the last 7 years to deal with my mental health, but everytime something new comes up, it never leaves. It adds to the pile of things I feel burdening me every time I wake up. Eventually, that pile suffocates me until I can't breathe. I have had countless medications and therapies to help me improve, but they clearly are not working anymore. I'm only 20, but I am tired, and jaded and sick to death of trying to live when I clearly don't. I'm ready to sleep.

I'm thankful to everyone for trying to help me over the last few years in dealing with my mental health, from my workmates making me feel normal when I didn't, my friends for reaching out, even just for a chat, a hang out or a game. My family, for asking me to do things with them and make me feel better. This is my choice, it shouldn't be up to others to constantly ensure I'm surviving and dragging them down with me. No one has failed, no one is to blame. *I choose* this.

I have been thinking about ending my life for a long time; this isn't a spur of the moment reaction to anything, more so a concrete decision made after years of difficulty, struggling and deteriorating mental health. I haven't felt confident, prepared, unafraid or any of the parts that used to take the form of Mika. I am what is left, a husk whose pilot is ready to land.

To my family; 

Mum, you've always been there for me even when I didn't know it or understand it. You are truly an admirable person that always put her children first and fought tooth and nail to make my childhood a great one. You succeeded on so many fronts and I'll never be able to put into words how much I love you. You gave me life and allowed me to experience so much greatness at your expense. A true Mum.

Dad, I wish we'd spent more time together, that I had reached out more. You're the only Dad I'll ever have, and I see so much of myself in you, like our humour and love for music. I can never thank you enough for the emotional rock you've been for me since I became ill as a teenager. You were always there for me during some of the toughest mental trials I've ever faced, and I'll never forget it.

Grandma and Grandad, I'll always be thankful for you in my life, providing me with help for university at the drop of a hat, always being there to help cultivate my love of nature and french culture. You are an example of hardwork and family commitment, what I always aspired to be.

Jazzi, you're easily one of the funniest, coolest people I know. Never giving a f\*ck about what others thought, I wished so hard to have those traits as my own, and I know you'll do so well in your life as a mad cat lady. 

Asa, I love your passion for the things you love. You're clearly a very loving person and it shows in everything you do. I wish I was as easily open as you are with feelings. Never stop living for your passions and the people who love you. 

Mya, I've always thought we maintained a fun rivalry, and I always looked up to you and the drive you have to be a success. The truth is, you already are and no-one can tell you otherwise. I've always admired the things you do and have done, and you should know how fantastic you are - a no-nonsense driven person, I have no doubts about your future successes. Make sure you take care of yourself.

Lil' Finn, my partner in crime, like Robin. You are the coolest kid I know. I always wanted to be as cool as you are. Laid back, bright as a bulb, my little brother. Do whatever you want to do, I know you'll be fine. Love you little bro.

To my friends:

Jakub, I'm sorry it came to this. You've been my best friend for so many years, you've been there for me during some tough stuff. I'm so thankful for your pragmatic sense to everything, and your appreciation of our friendship never went unreciprocated. Even though I'm not here, I know you'll do everyone around you proud. Get out there and show your talent. Its always been there. Love you dude.

A: I know you said you would feel guilty, but please don't be. We broke up, and that happens in life. It is up to people to decide how to continue, and I am trying to make great strides as I am sure you are, but I don't want to stride further. I don't think I can. Don't feel guilty, you're not why this has happened.

I can't list all of my friends as it would take forever. To all those friends that have given me their friendship over the last 20 years, I can't thank you enough for filling my life with different jokes, trips, experiences that I have always remembered and cherished, so thank you. You are all dear to me and I remember all of you for the friendship you have given me over the years, they are everything to me.

This is the end of my note. I hope one day you can find solace in my memory, rather than watch me grow old and become further indebted to the pain I'm feeling. I am truly sorry for what I have done. Please forgive me, and live life to the fullest.


I love you all, with all of my heart,

Your son, your brother, your friend.

655,depression,Pre-college despair,"I have anxiety and persistent depressive disorder since I was 18 years old, both diagnosed by psychologists and psychiatrists. I also had eating disorders (one continues to this day) and other things that are irrelevant.

Like many people here, I can't stop seeing the negative side of life and I can't stop overthinking everything.

I'm almost 21 years old and my life until today has been almost insignificant. I was abused and harassed throughout my life. Some situations were caused by my family, others by schoolmates. The truth is that I can't stand. I want to live but LIVE WELL, not in this very poor way. I don't have a job due to the pandemic and I'm not studying either because I don't have the courage to read what I have to read for college. My family has no money and we're in a pretty ugly situation.

I don't know whether to work and save money to be able to leave my country one day since is not a good quality of life here (Argentina) or study what I'm studying (psychology) and work in a precarious way for the rest of my life.

I can't find answers and I know that I'm not going to find them here either.

Nor do I find them in the psychologist or in the back of my thoughts, anywhere.

RECAP: I don't know what to do with my future and it makes me desperate. This has been going on for almost two years and I can't decide what to do, whether to follow something that I like, something that leave me a lot of money, or to leave the country.

I want to travel, meet people, feel free (I can't feel free here since the harassment I suffered at school traumatized me and it's hard for me to be in spaces with people I don't know).

Did anyone feel something like that? Did you feel lost before entering a university degree or working because you DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES? It really makes me desperate."
656,depression,"Fucking hell, I can fake it at work but the unrelenting emptiness I feel fucking kills me mentally...","I try to fill it with hobbies, games, useless shit but fuck man, I’m tired... everyone says to save money, go to school, plan for the future but honestly fuck that. I don’t want to. I don’t care. I don’t want to go to school to put myself in crippling debt. I don’t want to work for most of my life in a job I’ll hate, just to die a year after I retire, if I even can... I want to be happy. I’m not asking for special treatment cause I’m a “sensitive snowflake who can’t do anything”. I want a way out of this bullshit life. I feel my parents loved me just enough for me to know that if I died they’ed miss me. I wish I had no attachments, I wish something at work would just crush me, that no one would feel like they failed me... I don’t want to exist."
657,depression,I just want to eat my pain away,Lately I've been coping with food because I've only been feeling more depressed and suicidal I can't go a day without crying or thinking about killing myself and no one in my family seems to care told my mom I tried to kill myself she did absolutely nothing tried telling my parents about me being depressed and self harming but nothing so I've pretty much given up I've tried other things but they still didn't work so I just eat snacks and burgers all day my bf tried to comfort me but nothing really helps I just need a hug but like in real like I'm so sick of shit online I'm just so scared of myself and I never want to be alone but I always am and it's not fair I'm the only one who feels like this and no one ever cares even now I can't stop fucking crying it's just not fair...
658,depression,I'm scared to let myself be happy,Because I know it will just make it worse when I go crashing back down into a depressed state.
659,depression,Why do I get so upset when my friends are happy?,"So as bad as it’s sounds it’s one friend in particular, I do get upset when some of my other friends, but this one in particular.

I opened up about her finally about my cutting she was the first person I’ve ever told and well the first person I’ve told about any of my feelings. She has a ED and anxiety, so I felt like I could talk about my ED, self esteem issues and depression. 

But I guess the best why to say it is she’s gotten happy and confident and I’m still fucked up. She’ll post on instagram photo shoot she taken, but I could never do that. She’ll post on her snap story her looking cute and I get so upset because I could never do that. 

I told her I haven’t cut in a week after a really big break down and I wanted her to be proud and tell me I did good but she just shrugged it off. I’m a month clean even though this is probably one of the the worst months in a while and I want to tell her but what if she doesn’t give a shit.

I know I’m the bad person in this situation but I don’t know what to do."
660,depression,Just the truth :(,"You kinda do wonder what it's like to feel and be ok ? What it's like to genuinely feel happy for once? What its like to feel like your actually wanted to feel needed?

Like I've been pretty messed up my whole life I just kinda move from one sad thing to another it's like I wake up plaster a smile on my face and keep going with my life that's the same routine I've had for at least 3 years now. 

It's so fustrating when I tell people I have issues and they don't understand that what I need isn't someone to constantly be asking ""show me your wrists"" or ""are you ok?"". Because the truth is I can't explain why I'm not ok I'm just not ok I'm no where close to it. You asking me these things isn't going to stop me from trying to feel something.

*brief back story like 2 years back tops* 

I was doing good you know feeling like maybe I could get out the other side (if there is another side) 3 months down the line I've relapsed my ED and a lot of other problems are back but what hurts the most is that the people I trusted turned their backs on me when I needed them most. I could never commit I see and recognise that would be too much for my little sister to handle. My parents get a divorce and in the same year her older sister commits because her dad f**ked up her head with his emotional abuse and constant torments. I've learnt to block out my dad now I take the hits for her but most of the time I'm just a walking zombie because I don't want to be here anymore i don't want to die but i don't want to be alive and I don't know what to do :/"
661,depression,Girl pushing me away,"I was having a long distance relationship and 3 months in she started being different and ended up blocking me out of the blue for no reason. She told me later that she has had depression for several months and she got scared I might play her like all the other guys do. Since then she has just been different. There are times where she would push me away and not want to talk and tells me ""don't talk to me"" as if she is being a little aggressive/upset. Sometimes she lies about things and the last month she has been lying about having a boyfriend. 

Recently she seemed more comfortable talking to me and opening up a little more so I decided to question her about this boyfriend she mentions occasionally. I knew it might not go well to tell her that the person doesn't exist. I don't know if she actually believes her own lie or not but she wouldn't admit anything instead she was saying goodnight trying to leave the conversation.

Since that conversation she has been very different and has not wanted to talk to me and has been telling me that she needs some space and that she doesn't need anymore pressure on her. She used to be so close to me and seemed really happy to talk to me.

She tells me now that she is not comfortable talking to me and to leave her alone. Is there something I can say to her to make her feel comfortable again? I guess for questioning her lies she pushes me away... I just want to be able to talk to her again."
662,depression,I'm so annoyed,"I gotta tell you, as an American who cannot afford a therapist, I search for answers pretty much everywhere on how to help myself.  I already have an idea of what it is, is the fact that my brain has learned to associate SO many situations in my life with bad situations that it's constantly being reminded of said bad situation, and then it makes me depressed.  I've been trying to figure out how to re-wire my brain myself since I can't afford therapy sessions.

I live in NYC, so you meet a ton of people on the street who want to chat with you.  I met this one guy recently, he spoke of the fact that he felt ""awake"" and ""alive"" finally, when into detail that he teaches people how to feel that way.  He pretty much underlined issues with depression and such, so I'm thinking, wow someone who will help, ya know?

Noo, this guy, he goes on and on about how 5G is killing us all and how Bill Gates is going to insert microchips into us.

I'm so frustrated.  I know no one in the world owes it to help me, no one in the world is my personal therapist, unless I can pay them, but why is it the first time I finally FIND someone who I think would be willing to legitimately help is a conspiracy nut?

Or I went on this forum for abused survivors, and it's nothing but people preaching God, and can I please get real answers.  I don't need delusions, I need realistic solutions, and it's so hard to get there myself.

I'm so tired of feeling helpless and that I owe the world because my parents abused me so severely, and now I'm so mentally fucked.  No one takes me serious when I say I'm depressed, because ""DEPRESSION IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR ANYTHING."" or ""It doesn't exist.""

No one is here to truly care, no one is here to truly be open-minded, no one is here to understand that you are hurting on the inside.  I understand that people cannot comprehend because they do not feel that way, but I feel so alone.  I have no one to talk to about any of this, and trying to fix it myself is so difficult when I feel so dead from being alone."
663,depression,Mildly Successful but still depressed?,"I have all of the “ingredients” in my life that could make a person happy. I basically achieved exactly what my plan was for myself, as far as career wise. I have a wife, a few puppies, a house, nice car, good job, some nice things.

I guess a functioning depressed. Sometimes I just wish there was more to life, but then I feel like an asshole for not appreciating what I have at the same time. Can anyone relate to this?"
664,depression,my life is over,"cant get friends. cant get a partner. cant lose my depression. cant get ride of my severe sa. cant get ride of my vertigo. my whole life been a nightmare. i tried everything to get better but nothing works. whats the point of my life, to get tortured? i wish i got a terrible sickness so that i can die."
665,depression,Is there any way to get a diagnosis anonymously?,"I’ve never went to a doctor because of many reasons including public view on mental issues amongst family and friends and that I’m coping well enough, as in I don’t hurt myself physically or anything like that and I don’t think I have anything serious. I don’t think I need to see a therapist since I’m coping fine but I want to know if I have depression so that I’d feel like my feelings are valid and not just me being whiny/making excuses, etc. while being anonymous because I’d never want to go to see a doctor personally."
666,depression,Thought my insurance covered my therapy sessions. I was so wrong.,"I've been seeing a therapist for close to 4 months now. I only ever got one bill for about $60 right at the very start so I thought my health insurance was covering everything. Yesterday I got a bill for $600. I can't afford that so I have to stop seeing my therapist now and ask for a payment plan. 

Mental health is not taken seriously in this god forsaken country and I hate that even if you do have the emotional strength to seek out help, you're still going to get fucked anyway. I'd rather die than continue feeding this hell system."
667,depression,Moving in with other depressed roommates," Crosspost from  [https://old.reddit.com/r/getting\_over\_it/comments/iik511/getting\_other\_depressed\_roommates/](https://old.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/iik511/getting_other_depressed_roommates/) 

After months of dealing with my depression and anxiety alone, I've finally built up enough discipline to look at new apartments to move out of my toxic living situation. I can support myself financially, but I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to get a roommate who also suffers from depression so that we could help each other.

What do you all think? Do you think this is a good idea or could it swing in a horrible direction?"

670,depression,I don't think my friends like me,"Hi I'm at a lost to do I'm in my 20s and my girl friend group hate me I dunno what I did they just stopped inviting me to anything they never text they just don't care, one of them my longest friend still invites me to things when it's like her birthday and stuff but when I get there I know I'm not wanted. I'm over weight and have depression and anxiety they know this BTW.  I just feel like I'm not waited there and embrassed to be seen with me (they have mentioned about clothes I wear as jokes but I don't fit into nice clothes due to being fat)  I dunno what to do I'm lonely and wish I was a person they want to be friends with but I'm clearly not should I just stop trying and let them leave there lives without me annoying them. Is there a way to make friends at this age?  Late 20s?  Sorry rant"
671,depression,I don't know if I have depression,"So many people tell me I do and I don't know maybe there right. I just don't want to be happy. I don't deserve to be I've lied to everyone I've ever known my whole life. I've hurt a lot of people. 

Sometimes I feel happy and all I can think about is how everyone wants to die happy. So shouldn't I just kill my self when I'm happy?

Whenever I feel sad I just think what's the point of feeling sad I could just kill my self and not be sad anymore.

I don't feel like I'm depressed but I know I want to die. The only thing that stops me is that people would be upset about it. I think they all just don't understand that this is what I want. My life should be about what makes me happy and if the though of death makes me happy shouldn't they want that? I think they would all be happier if I was gone anyway I know it would take a wile to get over but I'm not really anything special so I don't know what the big deal is about.

Sorry for this long post I guess I just wanted somewhere to rant. Maybe I'm just crazy and all my guild and all my self hatred doesn't make any sense.

My friend killed her self a couple weeks ago, at first I was sad. It took maybe 17 hours for me to realize that I was just jealous she got what I always wanted and I understood why she did it. So I wasn't going to be sad about it anymore because I wouldn't want the people I care about to be sad if it was me. I know they could never be happy for me to get what I want but why can't they just understand? This is all I am all I've even been for as long as I've known what death was I've wanted it. It just feels like what I need. It feels like everything I need, I just don't want the people I care about to be sad because of me."

673,depression,My life is going in a downwhirl spiral and I can't stop it,"I'm a 25F. I live in the city. And I'm getting closer everyday to buying a gun and shooting myself.

A month and a half ago I was at my happiest. Everything was going amazing. Then within the last 3 weeks everything went to shit. Unemployed still and the jobs I was suppose to have fell through. I don't have enough with unemployment to pay next months bills or rent. The girl I was suppose to live with used me and now I'm stuck in a house that she use to sell drugs out of. The guy I was talking to and was close to being serious with decided to end things a week and a half ago. I've been drinking and doing drugs everyday and my friends are trying to get me to slow down. But everytime I try to take it easy the night somehow turns into mistake after mistake. I blacked out last night once more and took a man home I'd never even flirt with if I was sober. I can still taste him and smell him no matter how many times I clean myself or brush my teeth. My one friend made out with me at the bar we were at prior to that and then tried to get me to suck his dick in the bathroom at our friends house before I left. I feel so dirty. I feel like because I slept with someone the guy I use to talk to won't ever want to talk to me again in the future. Which is stupid because I knew the day he ended things he would never come back regardless of if I slept with someone after him or not. 

I want to go to the hospital to check myself in because I'm scared how close I am to ending it. But if I do that everyone will find out and my family will force me to move back home. And moving back home would kill me just as much as a gun to my head. It's getting harder and harder to make my eyes look alive. I can't remember the last time I truly smiled and meant it. I don't know what to do. I'm pushing my friends away with my behavior so I feel even more alone than I am. I'm ignoring my family. 

How do you feel numb, broken, angry, sad and unable to cry all at the same time? I don't know what to do. I'm barely eating. I'm taking sleeping pills to sleep the days away so I'm not tempted to drink or do drugs. I so badly want to go to someone about this. But I can't. 

I feel like at this rate I won't be around to see the end of September. And even though that thought scares me a little, the idea of being gone fills me with relief. I don't want to be here anymore."
674,depression,College is so overwhelming,"I'm just using this post as a way to vent what I'm feeling right now to a crowd of strangers.

A little about me - I'm a 19 year old male on the autism spectrum. I was diagnosed with depression several years ago and am medicated. There have been many ups and downs, but I have come a long way from where I was.

College has been such a ""humbling"" experience. And by humbling, I mean that it made me realize that I am not shit. I am actually not capable of doing very many things at all that an independent person can do.

I honestly feel like a total imposter. I don't belong here at all. I have no friends and I live in a studio apartment. I work a part time shitty food service job. I can't fucking focus to study for my classes and when I do I don't understand anything going on.

I am very scared of being a failure. I feel like I will not amount to anything."
675,depression,How do I help my friend with depression,"My friend is diagnosed with clinical depression and vents often to me about how she doesn't have much motivation to even do simple tasks like clean the dishes or take out the garbage. I'm no therapist so I'm not really qualified to give advice in this field but I really want my friend to prosper and improve her life. I remember when I had depression that shit sucked ass, but I don't remember how I coped with it or how I fixed it. I wish I remember what I did in her situation so I could be wise enough to help her. Does anyone have any advice for helping my friend?"

You won’t find a new country, won’t find another shore.  


This city will always pursue you.  


You’ll walk the same streets, grow old  


in the same neighborhoods, turn gray in these same houses.  


You’ll always end up in this city. Don’t hope for things elsewhere:

681,depression,i want school back in lockdown,"online schooling was easy. i’m a quite good student with only A’s and B’s (or my country’s equivalent) so i didn’t have any problems with teaching the stuff myself. i also have a family where everyone studied at university that could help me with my weaker subjects. i know i’m privileged due to my home situation. i have my own room and laptop, wifi works and i don’t need to babysit younger siblings. school lockdown meant that i could sleep in, didn’t have to actually go to school and wouldn’t be bored anymore in subjects like english (esl with me speaking english at reading great gatsby niveau). 
i got bullied for eight years in school and my anxiety to see my classmates is high, to say the least. i’m tired and overwhelmed with seeing ~60-150 people everyday (depending on my classes) and i can’t concentrate when periods are only 45 minutes long. everything’s exhausting. it’s been three weeks and my mental health is as bad as when i started therapy in december. 

i just can’t do this anymore. i want to do online again."
682,depression,Nobody would care if i was dead,"People would be relieved.nobody in my family, i have the worst friend's in the world so it's not like they would care nobody cares about me.

My life was put on hold for the longest time until 3018, when I got my first job. Since then I've been in a relationship that ended up with me in the hospital for wanting to attempt suicide, finding another love, and getting a promotion. I've been living with my family this entire time, and now things are spiraling out of control. My mom wants to move halfway across the country, with or without me, I've yet to get even a learner's permit for a car, and she wants to leave in a couple months time. Either I go with her, throwing away relationship, my job, and all of my friends and life, or I stay here, and struggle with just trying to stay alive. My head spins as I try to take back control of my life, but it overwhelms me, and I'm bursting into tears as I type this. I feel like everything I do is for naught, and that I don't mean anything to anyone. I can't even find the energy to be happy for my birthday which is in a couple weeks, because it just means that it's a couple weeks closer to me potentially being left behind by my entire family."

I'm afraid of waking up because of how much more shit I have to deal with the next day. This will go on for 6 years. This wasn't the life I wanted, but my mom never gave me a choice. I want to pack my shit and go far away. I won't be able to get a place to stay nor a way to make money. I'll most likely end up dead, but thats the point right? I can't go on anymore. My journey is over"
687,depression,Almost everything that can go wrong HAS gone wrong lately...,"So, school just started. I transferred to a CSU this semester, finally, from a community college. I've been at community college for a LONG time, so I was very excited to finally transfer. And then quarantine happened. This means my entire first year at University is online. I'm not good with online classes normally, and I'm an English major, meaning I have all/mostly English classes. Those are hard enough in-person. But okay, I'll get through it.

I knew that with the transfer comes lots of new paperwork, so I made sure to start it early on. Like before I even graduated from CC, which was May 2020. So I fill out all the paperwork I need to, then a few months later, it says I need to fill out MORE paperwork for financial aid. I do that, and I check my account every day to see if something has changed. Finally it says I've completed everything, but 2 weeks go by and I still haven't heard anything from the school about when/if I'll be receiving my financial aid. I try to call the school, but I always end up on hold for hours and have to hang up due to class/work. I try to use their online chat, but it's always offline. I finally just email them. I get a response yesterday saying that my aid was awarded on the 26th and I will be receiving it Friday (today). I hop on this morning to check and... nothing. By now, I'm so frustrated with everything that I'm practically shaking. I'm able to get ahold of someone in the financial aid office via the chat feature, and I'm told that they STILL HAVE TO REVIEW MY APPLICATION. Apparently, they can't review the grant until it's been awarded, and they have to do it manually, and there's a whole lot of students ahead of me. It'll take AT LEAST 2 weeks to finish the review and get my refund.

And of course, I'm not getting the amount I was originally told (near $12,000 per semester). I'm barely getting a quarter of that (LESS THAN $3,000). FOR UNIVERSITY. I received twice as much at CC! I don't understand why I'm getting so much less from 2 grants compared to what I got from 1 grant at CC. And, the grant I received already went fully into my tuition...AND I STILL OWE $955.

The icing on the cake is that the brand new $300 phone I bought (I've never spent this much on a phone, mind you. I was just tired of my cheap phones dying on me so soon and having to replace them every year) I accidentally threw in the washer, as it was wrapped up in my sheets. I've NEVER done anything like this to my electronics and am usually really careful with checking and shaking things out before they go into the washer. It was only in there like 2 minutes, if that, but it was fully submerged. It's going to cost as much to fix it as it will to just buy a new one...which I can't do without the financial aid.

And of course, to make the situation so much worse, I live in an extremely toxic household. The first amount I was told I was receiving for financial aid, paired with what I make from work, was enough to help my fiancee and I to move out on our own finally and get some space from my family. It's not going to happen now. Not with such a small amount of financial aid. Even with my fiancees 2 jobs, we don't make enough to move out.

Even better, I'm in danger of loosing my job because of COVID. I work for a CC as a tutor, and because we're fully online now, our numbers for how many students we get have severely dropped. If we don't get the numbers up, they might shut us down.

I just can't take it anymore. I'm literally at the end of my rope and I'm losing whatever's left of my mind. I've been trying to hold myself together, but I dread waking up every day for fear of what else will go wrong. Idk what I'm looking for here. Just a place to vent and get my frustration out before I completely snap. Sorry it's so long, but thanks for reading."
688,depression,Going threw a phase?,"Hey so I’m just gonna get to the point, normally I don’t cry or have any sad feeling or at least in a while. I might just be over reacting but I was really bored one day watching videos, then I got an ad to something called roomies- some hentai Dojin- tbh I was already having no feeling - something called close as neighbors was it and read it and loved it- now I’m just sad and rereading it - the main point was to enjoy myself and now I’m crying over it - the genre was drama so... This could be stupid to you but I haven’t felt that emotion in awhile and it seems that itl never end"

690,depression,My depression lifted?,"I've had depression for years now, but yesterday I woke up feeling... Extremely stable. It felt really ""normal"" and that kind of threw me off so I tried to think about things depression makes me think about and.. Nothing, no mental response from my mind. It's like it doesn't care about it all anymore. I never ever felt like this since the beginning of my depression. I also started rapidly losing weight since this stability begun. Anybody here experienced this? Is it temporary? Or did my depression actually lift overnight?"
692,depression,Reaching out is a joke.,Nobody even bothered to care. I tried hints for months and nobody noticed. I moved on to a straight “I want to kill myself” to the one person I trust enough to tell and he was kinda too shocked to help. I’m broken and done.

I just wanted to tell my story and feel like I've been kicked while I was down

I just wanted to vent and maybe get some feedback but instead I'm just going to sit here and cry because that literally took so much of me to openly talk about some of the hardest periods of my life. I wrote drafts of my goodbye letters today"
694,depression,i feel like a shitty friend,"my friend's uncle died, they went to me and told me they don't know who else to talk to. i completely said the wrong things. see, my dad died a couple years ago and i thought bringing up my own experiences and suggesting things that helped me would help them, maybe make them feel a little less alone. but i think it just made things worse. they talked to me about how they're sad there was no funeral or viewing for their uncle, that he wants to be cremated, and i ignorantly suggested keeping some of his ashes because that's what i did with my dad's. but their uncle doesn't want his ashes kept. i also suggested they could look at photos of him, but they don't have any photos of him. i felt really bad and apologized a lot, but they left all my messages on read and finally said they don't want to talk. i feel like i really fucked up and i feel so shitty. i shouldn't have given unsolicited advice in the first place. i feel selfish as hell for even getting so upset about this because i know they're grieving and they have a right to not want to talk to me. i just hate myself so much and sometimes i wish i didn't exist"
695,depression,Nothing makes me happy,"Ever since my girlfriend left me, I've felt increasingly awful.  All I want to do is sleep because nothing else helps me.  I don't listen to music anymore, or watch TV, or play video games. I take anti-depressants and go to therapy, but nothing ever changes my state of mind.  I genuinely feel like I don't have any reason to continue living. Does anybody know how to come back from that feeling?"
696,depression,What’s your coping mechanism?,"Hi, what works for you guys on dealing with depression?

I stopped drinking 2 years ago and my favorite coping mechanisms at the moment are coffee and weed but I’m trying to ween off both as they worsen my anxiety.

I used to exercise pretty frequently at my office gym but it has been difficult to find motivation to work out at home but that’s used to help a lot to control anxiety."
697,depression,"Parents fighting, anxiety going up, mother crying.","It fucks me up living in a toxic environment. They always fight and hurt each other with words and then ask me why i never cheer up and laugh. I'm sick and tired of this shit, makes me wanna kill myself"
698,depression,I thought i could try and let things get better but they have only gotten worse. posting only because i’ve got nowhere else to vent and be sad.,"i’ve been very sad for a long time. some days i feel extremely happy and sometimes okay, but at the end of the day i’m never happy with anything. i’m never happy for more than a period of 4 hours. maybe after i hit the gym or something, no matter what i just go back to my crumbling life.

Overall i’m extremely lucky and fortunate to have a loving family. Although they are loving there are secret problems most don’t know about, whether it’s my brother, my father, my mother, etc. A lot of shit has happened between my brother and me and my mother, and i hardly see my homeless father anymore. 

I’m 19 and i’m a piece of shit deep down and i’ll never be able to forgive myself for my actions. I don’t want any help anymore, my mom is the only person who cares enough to help anyway, but she has enough problems and i can’t ask her to love me anymore than she already does. I’ve been to therapy, learned how much money was being taken from my mother and i decided to quit. I’ve only been causing problems for others and making people’s lives harder than they should be.

I go to a mediocre community college for a degree i couldn’t give a shit about. I keep failing in mostly everything i do and i’ve been working to better myself for a long time now. i’m not seeing improvements and life isn’t getting better. one year ago i had planned to kill myself, but my mother talked me through it and i didn’t. I’ve now waited a year and although lots has changed, most of it has gotten worse. I’m a failure, a loser, and i don’t deserve anymore attention or love, not like i’ve had any from anyone but my family anyways. I’m not making myself anyone else’s problem ever again, fuck that my mother to deal with already. Not sure if i’ll stick around too much longer but we will see."
699,depression,Let a little compassion in,"Practice compassion and self-compassion. By definition, compassion is the sympathetic pity and concern for the suffering and misfortune of others. Recognize the pain and be kind to it. It is a part of life, after all. 

In The Phantom of the Opera, there is a scene where the Phantom holds Christine, his muse, captive in his underground living quarters. Raoul, Christine’s fiancé, treks down to the water-laden caves to retrieve Christine only to find himself locked outside the gate, able to see The Phantom holding Christine hostage and unable to enter. 

**Phantom:** I think my dear – we have a guest.

**Christine:** Raoul!

**Phantom:** This is, indeed, an unparalleled delight. I had rather hoped that you would come. And now, my wish comes true. You can make my night. 

**Raoul:** Free her! Do what you like only free her! Have you no pity?

**Phantom:** Your lover makes a passionate plea.

**Christine:** Please Raoul it’s useless.

**Raoul:** I love her. Does that mean nothing? I love her. Show some compassion!

Then the Phantom looks right at Raoul and yells –

**Phantom:** The world showed no compassion to me!

Compassion leads to kindness toward yourself and others, but especially to yourself. If you resent your pain, ignore your darker emotions and refuse to partake in a healing process you are shutting the curtain to allow any compassion to surround your pain. Compassion feels like finally slouching your shoulders after sitting straight like a needle for an hour. It is a gentle understanding that yes, there is pain, and yes, it is okay and no, we will not judge ourselves or run from it."
700,depression,How to talk to someone who attempted suicide?,My cousin (17F) tried to kill herself today. She slit her wrists and swallowed pills. Fortunately her friend found her in time and she's in hospital now. I'd like to visit her tomorrow but I don't even know how to talk to her and if we should address the elephant in the room or just leave her alone and try to take her mind off what happened.
701,depression,Just what I think,"Some people are depressed and they are scared to get help. I am so depressed I Don't want to get help. But, I have survived 5 years of depression since 2nd grade. This is how you don't kill yourself:

Think about your family, friends, pets, etc.

Do you want to leave them at your funeral? Do you want them to get depression like you and kill themselves? Would you?Think about them every time you hold a blade, point a gun open the car lock, open a window, etc. and remember don't die for them. You might hate yourself, but as long as you don't hate something in the world. DONT

(if you have no family, friends, pets, jobs, etc., you might as well.)"
702,depression,My worst moment in high school," In high school, I went through some mean, ugly girl-drama. I was on the swim team and had a good group of friends. We spent all our time together – every weeknight at practice, the mornings at 5 AM, and every weekend at swim meets. We were very tightknit. One Friday afternoon at practice, all my friends got out of the pool early and went to the locker room to shower and change – they had somewhere to go. I was confused. We didn’t make plans for the weekend, did we? I don’t remember needing to pack an extra change of clothes for anything. 

It was then that I found out the whole group of girls decided to exclude me from their plans, which were to spend a weekend in New York City visiting another friend in our group that had recently moved there due to her dad’s job. We were freshmen in high school, and I was absolutely crushed. It was as if the whole cast of FRIENDS decided to take a trip to visit Courteney Cox and everyone – including their significant others - made travel arrangements, planned weekend activities, and just left without ever even telling Jennifer Aniston a peep about it. 

My ""friends"" planned an involved weekend trip (as a freshmen, you don’t just plan a trip to New York on a whim. Parents were involved, and it likely took a good chunk of time and effort to coordinate), but I was completely in the dark about all my friends leaving for the weekend to visit OUR friend in New York.

What did I do wrong? They must not like me anymore - why? Everything was fine up until right now. How can they spend all this time planning a trip to New York without ever mentioning a peep to me? Not even an invite – nothing. I literally could not comprehend what was going on. I was so hurt. I remember going home that evening and sitting in my shower, hot water turned high, and feeling the drops hit my head and neck over and over and over. I cried the whole night. I had never experienced such hurt before. 

As I laid in bed that night, out of tears, I wondered if other people had been through the same drama. I thought, I’m just one girl at this one high school in the suburbs. There must be another girl at some random high school in Arizona or Texas or Michigan that has gone through her own girl drama and has felt what I’m feeling now. Then I thought about how many high schoolers there might be in the US at that point in time and how many of them, guys and girls, are going through their own tumultuous growing pains. Not that I was glad others were hurting, but it was comforting to know I wasn’t alone. My pain was shared. My life experience was similar to other’s life experiences and maybe my side of the story could be understood. 

I used my imagination a bit. I imagined I met a girl from another high school later in life. Maybe we were in our 20’s. We met at the airport or something and got to chatting. I told her my story about mean girls in my high school experience and, in my imagination, she stopped our conversation, looked right at me and said “omg, the *exact* same thing happened to me!” There is comfort in having shared pain. 

Know that you are not alone. Others have gone through it, and others will go through it. Sure, the details of your story might be different, but the shock you feel and the pain it brings are not unique to your life. Take comfort in the fact that, as human beings, we are collectively trudging through the ups and downs of our tough times."
703,depression,Just venting,"Repeatly I'm thinking about just.. slitting my wrist. Or jump off a bridge. Idek why. I'm starting to feel more depressed again. Probably cuz winter is coming and the days get darker over here. It pissed me off that I feel like depression will always stay in my mind, somewhere. 

My boyfriend only shows affection when he is having a ""switch"" to an alter, or whatever. I feel like I won't ever be truly loved. 

I'm fat, even tho I've been puking for year(s) now. Since I'm doing it way more and I almost don't eat anything anymore, I'm finally losing weight. I completely know it's unhealthy and I'm taking this risk anyway. Whenever I eat a normal meal, I feel full and I feel upset. 'I need to get it out of me' is what constantly goes through my mind. 

I can't vent anonymously anymore. This is my 3rd account now, cuz my boyfriend constantly wants to know my account name. And I can't explain properly how venting anonymous is nice, so I end up giving the account name so he stops being angry.

Sometimes I feel like depression became a part of my identity. After a severe depressed episode, I finally cheered up bit by bit. For weeks it felt so weird to have no thoughts running through my mind all day. I felt so light and it was a bit uneasy. 
Then I was used to it, but my fear (I have PTSD) for certain things became worse. And these days I'm kinda happy, making lots of autistic sounds through the day ;) but in the evening I feel bad, empty. Being in my thoughts deeply while I question the point of life.

Now I'm waiting for my friend to go too far with his weird behaviour so I have a reason to dissapear or die.

I used to enjoy youtube videos of my favourite youtubers. But now I only feel jealous as they get to explore the world and experience things, while I'm being depressed every night and do the same stuff every day. No friends have the same thoughts or likes I have.

I also feel angry/kinda upset cuz I'm not doing special things. I'm not reaching top goals. I wanna reach something in my life. But it gives me a constant stress.

I'm too tired to end the post properly. So goodnight/have a nice day."
704,depression,Just a thought..,I was so embarrassed to tell anyone I was an alcoholic as a female.. It seems like it’s been made to be an issue with males. (No offense at all) I work at a hospital and I was always relieved to see a female come in for issues. NOT HAPPY that they were having problems or in pain or anything like that obviously. Just relieved to see females also suffer from this ugly nonsense. It was nice just to feel like I wasn’t alone.
705,depression,My parents problems make me feel like this:,"i wish to dead, i really want that with the most painful way ever. i wish to stop breathing , i wish my heart stop , i wish the pain i feel right now gone even if i dead just i want it to stop . please stop , i can't take all this on my owne.
 I beg you, my God, take my soul and let me die.  I've had enough of this life.  I don't want to be in pain anymore, I don't want you to hear my mother crying and my father screaming anymore.  All I hope is for all of this to disappear."
706,depression,Everyones moving on except me,"I feel like everyone is moving on with their lives and moving forward. My friends have moved on to new friends, my brothers are moving on and moving out, my parents are moving to a different state, just everything is changing and im the one factor thats staying the same."
707,depression,I can’t deal with this anymore.,"Hi, 

I just don’t know how I can describe my situation. I’ll skip to the part how I feel right now. I’m extremely depressed. I deal with anxiety a lot. My mind is in a battle. I got overwhelmed with intrusions all the time. Derealization/depesonalization happens constantly. I can’t watch tv, listen to music or take a proper walk. I don’t feel comfortable constantly. I can’t make proper conversation. I can’t make proper conversation with strangers at all or people I don’t know too well. I’m 21, dealing with this for 4 years. It has gone worse and worse. Been in therapy twice but it didn’t help. Diagnose is agoraphobia, generalized anxiety and add. But the diagnose confuse me. Anyway, I feel like I can’t deal with this for much longer. I got suicidal thoughts, but I also am pretty sure I won’t do it. I can’t even walk outside so yeah. Scared of everything. I’m giving up. I can’t live like this. My mental disorder has taken away every bit of me."
708,depression,I would rather die than have a job,"Why? Why am I one of the people who has to labor and toil all my damn life just for the privilege of waking up to another day of work? Why do some people get to have so much money that they never have to work; that they would never have to work even if they lived for thousands of years??

I’m not going to be able to afford tuition unless I work. I’d also literally rather be dead than ever work another day in my life. I’m 23 and have had 6 jobs since I turned 16. I’m already sick of it. I’m trapped and out of options, which is when the pills and knives come out. Im not made to live in this stupid fucking world."
709,depression,My GPA is so low I might just kill myself,"I'm not kidding I'm so close to killing myself. The rat poison and pain killers are right there.

I should have raised my grade dispite the depression. Or died.

Update: I feel better now I don't die today"
710,depression,It's been a rough year on top of everything that's been going on. I don't have a reason to continue,"To preface, I'm not necessarily a nihilist. I do believe that there is a reason people live and why you should etc. However, I don't see why I should. I'm still a teenager, I know I have a lot of life ahead of me, but I just want to take the easy way out. My life isn't bad by all means. I have amazing parents, I have 4 siblings (really 3 but one of my closest friends who I live with is basically a brother to me at this point). I do have some friends and I love gaming so there's my hobby. My college classes just started back up and I have my distractions ya know?

Not everything is peachy and nice as it sounds. Last year I went to my college's counseling center because one of my friends forced me to because I was just feeling extra suicidal. I've dealt with suicidal thoughts for the past 5, almost 6 years now, and I've pretty much kept most of it to myself. I used to have a best friend who I'd go to anytime I just felt like killing myself because she would always help me out and give me a reason to stay, but after a while I just felt like a massive burden to her, and we starting drifting apart. It's been over 7 months since we've last talked and I've tried really hard to get over it because she's off doing better things and I'm still the same person I've always been. No matter how much I try to change, I just end up going back to how I used to be. After 1 visit, literally ONE 15 MINUTE TALK, I WAS SENT TO A HOSPITAL TO TALK ABOUT IT. I had no say in the matter, I still had class and the counselor thought the best course of action was to send me to a hospital. I was the psych center, not allowed to use my phone or electronics to tell anyone what was going on, I had to change out of my clothes just for safety measures, I was given shit food to eat, I said the same thing I did to my counselor to the ""professional therapists"" only to be treated like nothing was wrong and that I was crazy. Just nothing was going my way. On top of that, even though I was 18, I still had to get picked up by my parents and older sister, who were all at work at the time, and just made them super panicked and scared for no reason. I wasn't planning on killing myself then, but it was still a lingering thought. To make matters worse, my parents had to pay for the ambulance that took me to the hospital (thank you so much american health care system) which was no more than a 10 minute drive, and they had to pay a couple hundred dollars on top of insurance payments. From there on, my life just kept going downhill because I don't even know if my parents or older sister forgot about it or just aren't talking to me about it and there's no way in hell I'm telling them how I fell. I also stopped going to friends for help whenever I felt suicidal because not only did I lose trust in them after that situation, no one has every really been there for me other than my friend who I mentioned earlier.

My suicidal thoughts &amp; self harming actions just started to come back after about 3 months of not really thinking or doing anything. I tend to find myself awake all night just thinking about how much better everyone's lives would be if I was dead. Anytime I try to force myself to sleep, those thoughts keep coming back, so I stay up until I just can't anymore and sleep not caring about what goes on through my head. Games and school could only take me so far in terms of distracting me. Same with youtube videos and netflix movies/shows. I've failed so many times at doing things, I get too overconfident which causes me to fail even harder, and I just can't anymore. Everything would be better if I just left everything behind. Being a guy just makes things even worse because not only is mental health taken seriously for guys, it just makes my parents and siblings look bad if their child/brother took his own life and the family wasn't there to help.

I know it's extremely selfish to think that way, that taking my life would be best for everyone, but it's just true. I'm always everyone's last resort/backup if something doesn't go right. I'm stubborn as hell so everything just becomes an argument even though I don't want it to be. Not only does everything become an argument, but I'm the one who gets blamed for starting it when someone just can't take no for an answer or whenever I change my mind on a subject. To be frank, I've never been in a serious relationship, hell, I've never even hugged someone outside of family ever. Most people just hold me, I never hug back unless I'm forced to. I lack emotional attention because I'm just too scared to reach out for help, I lack physical interaction because I'm super self conscious and anxious in all situations. I just have nothing going for me in life and it'll just be easier if ya know, I ended my life here, and have people forget about my existence quick because I haven't really left a mark on anyone and even my family forget about me from time to time.

Anyway, I'm sorry for such a long post. I haven't been able to talk to anyone about anything and I've had all these emotions bottled up inside me for the longest and I felt like if I didn't say anything, I'd just end up hurting myself more than I already have. Thanks for reading if you did, I hope you have a great day and stay safe, especially during these times!"
711,depression,Rant about life,"Honestly, most days I don't know what to do, what to say
I just work
Sure I'll go home and see my family and see my friends but there i am still with a mask up.
I'm still completely destructive towards myself
I don't care sometimes where I end up. 
I did care about my girlfriend and more and more, year and 6 months later. She stopped Caring, kept saying to me that things are gonna get better
But they are not, they really aren't 
And I'm just in a ball of hatred Because I feel like every day that I caused this. I caused this distance. That everything is my fault."
712,depression,I really hate my life,"I really hate myself. I hate that I live with my parents and I have a 1 and half year old daughter. I have a shit job and a worthless college bachelors degree. I’m worthless. I’m a piece of shit. I hate my douchebag fucking father. He’s the fucking worst and is a main reason why I have depression. Fuck him. 

I hate that my ex dumped me bc I’m a fucking idiot and never took care of my depression for years. I loved her so much. My own daughter cries when she’s left with me bc im miserable. No medications work. Therapy doesn’t work. All I am is a nuisance to everyone. I hate everything about my life. I wish I had enough courage to kill myself. I really want to die and I think about it all day long everyday."
713,depression,What's the point?,"When I was young, I was a, sort of, edgy teenager; thinking how 'woke' and 'smart' I am for believing there's no meaning to life, everything is bad and et cetera. 
Then I started to enjoy things, and I liked doing stuff; reading, maybe exercising, some favorite subjects. 
But for the past years, I barely care about important things, or things I've used to enjoy.
I'm not really depressed (I apologize for posting in this subreddit, it felt the most appropriate), I don't feel sadness nor extreme numbness.
It's also not that I feel anything for absurdism or existentialism; I just don't care.
Why do I even continue? What do I want to achieve; what is my goal? I have none. I just feel like an empty shell, waiting for some kind of a breakthrough, maybe a comment on the internet would help.
But it wouldn't, would it? Perhaps I write this in hope I'll feel better somehow.
But it doesn't matter, does it? Nobody actually cares. For all it matters, I'm just a human, one of many, that feels lost."
714,depression,Why is talking to other people so exhausting especially on really hard and dark days?,I feel I never have energy anymore to talk to anyone and love avoiding simple texts or messages from friends. It’s just so exhausting to think through and respond to people
715,depression,Snap friends,Anyone that’s a decent person want to be friends on Snapchat? I need someone to talk to right now :(
716,depression,I’m so tired of feeling alone,"I’m gay... in a Catholic homophobic family — with a grandfather who gay bashed. So I’ve spent my entire life hiding who I am. Which I guess has been the easiest part. What’s the worst part is seeing my cousins; my family; my friends; everyone around me be happy with their partners. The thing is, I know I’m not good enough. I’m not good looking, and no matter how hard I try my body will be average. Hell, I’ve been told to my face more than once that I’m ugly. So I get why I don’t have anyone. But I still long for it so badly.

And I have recently made so much more friends, which has been a shock, and I know as soon as they find out that I’m gay I’m going to be left alone again. And I know when my family finds out that’s when I know I’ll have no one left. 

I just don’t know how long I can keep feeling like this. I can’t keep doing this on repeat. It’s too hard.

Sorry, I just wanted to get this all out into the open."
717,depression,I’m not happy anywhere,"During the lockdown my depression has grown, I live in the dark since 3 years ago I wasn’t the same anymore and neither the people around me. My mother started working very hard for her own and didn’t spend enough time with me, I changed and she couldn’t see it because she was too busy. My father doesn’t like his job anymore but spends a lot of time there. During the lockdown it seems that they only see my defaults.... And I was alone with my sadness... i am alone with my sadness, but normally I can talk with my friends and smile a bit. I will go back to school soon but I hate it, and I hate my home I also feel as I was only talking about myself, but talking to who ? Anyway I hope it’s going to be better soon..."
718,depression,It's almost 6pm and I'll start drinking,I'll drink in order to forget how depressed I am. I'm only happy when I'm drunk. 🥴
719,depression,Persistence of isolation,"I dont want to give it away

Buried deep in my regrets

The voices complained, you don't want this you don't like this

Wallowing incorrect resistant to change

How can I feel so alone in this crowded room

Fear playing it safe

When did I start to care

Feelings I will never share

But dont worry I'll be there

This loneliness is more than I can bare"
720,depression,Hey there,"Hi, well, this is my first post on this subreddit and basically on all of Reddit. Ok, I don't really know why I write this, maybe it's because I want to leave something to remind me that I'm trying. The point is, this is the first time in a looooong time that I want to try again, to fight back, to finally get my shit together, and to be honest, I'm fucking terrified, because I've tried to get up before, I've tried to fight back, failing to do so. I'm so afraid that if I get up, I'll fall again, but for once in these long four years governed by my depression, I'm not going to let my fears control me. For the people who are reading this, who are in the same or worse condition than I am: get up, fight, I know life is hard and I'm pretty sure everyone here knows that, that life throws you, kicks you and spits you out, but once in a while I think we should give that bitch a spoonful of her own medicine, just once in a while hehehe. I think I'm going to post my progress here, even though I don't really know what that means, idk, I guess posting every week what I'm doing, or what I've accomplished, that kind of thing. Thanks a lot to you, reader, who have dedicated a portion of your time to reading this, and remember: don't give up, don't stop fighting, never.

721,depression,Has anyone found a medication that actually works for them?,"Has anyone found an antidepressant that actually works for them? I’ve tried Mirtazapine, Prozac, Zoloft, Wellbutrin and Lexapro. Each for a bit over a year except for the Prozac which was ~3 years so I definitely gave them a chance and had time to adjust. 

Prozac, Zoloft and Lexapro all made me sleep for about 20 hours a day, they also made me terribly binge and purge during the little time I was able to stay awake (for some background info, I’ve also suffered from anorexia for ~10 years). Completely apathetic, zero emotion. Whilst it was nice to have a break from constant ruminating depressive thoughts and panic attacks, I was still suicidal because I didn’t even feel like a person, so what was the point of living.

Mirtazapine also made me a zombie, I was falling asleep standing up at work, one time I fell asleep and my elbow went into the fryer full of hot oil (I still have the burn scar). No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t stay awake. I started buying black market stims just to function, but I was still having micro sleeps every 15 minutes or so and when I when I wasn’t at work, I was either aimlessly wondering around food stores, binging and purging, or sleeping. Nothing else. I even started shoplifting at the supermarket/food stores. This is completely unlike me at all, I have a very strong sense of morals and typically would be terrified at the idea of getting caught, so I have no idea what drove me to do it but it became a compulsion. I just thought, what’s the point of anything? If I get caught, so what? I didn’t care about anything at all, and felt like I was outside of my body, just watching it do things and the world go by, but I wasn’t actually physically present.

Wellbutrin was the best but yet also the worst for me. I had a seizure and have since been told by every doctor other than the one who prescribed it that it should not be given to eating disorder patients for that very reason. The mornings were incredible, a few hours after taking it I would be happy almost to the point of euphoria. I would get up and about at 5am each day, extremely motivated and productive. However, I was also very unstable, Wellbutrin was like a rollar coaster. Despite feeling amazing in the mornings, after a few hours (even when I began taking a second dose of the afternoon) I experienced a crash. Extremely over emotional, irritable, panic attacks, uncontrollable crying, obsessively replaying the same thoughts and self harming deeper and more frequently than usual. I experienced hyperkinesis and tics, and I would also be awake for days on end only sleeping a few hours every few days. Aside from the few incredible hours of euphoria in the mornings I became extremely on edge and paranoid, the last straw was hallucinations. My anorexia loved Wellbutrin because I could go for a week without food or water with ease.

I have no idea why I seem to have experienced such drastic and extreme side effects to every medication I’ve tried. Substances have always affected me far more than most. One drink of alcohol and I’m drunk, even when I was a very heavy drinker for two years. It may be to do with autoimmune diseases I have that impact my metabolism, perhaps I don’t metabolise drugs the way they’re supposed to be processed? Perhaps I was just unlucky, it’s uncommon to have experienced even some of the rare side effects so severely.

I would really like to find something similar to the way Wellbutrin made me feel for those few hours of the day, but with far more stability and obviously without the side effects. Bupropion/Wellbutrin is also known to aggravate anxiety in a lot of people which is something I suffer from. SSRIs don’t seem to agree with me so I’m looking more at atypical and other kinds. I would rather something that doesn’t typically cause weight gain (I know that can still be a possibility but I mean the ones that are likely to cause it, like Mirtazapine for instance). So sorry for the long post but I felt like it was relevant to include my past experiences in looking for recommendations! Thanks in advance if you can share something that’s worked for you xxx 💖"
722,depression,I need some advice from someone who doesn’t have depression helping their girlfriend.,Hey peeps. My girlfriend has depression and has been on medication for awhile now. She has been doing fantastic! All of a sudden the other week she had a depression episode and was feeling awful. So instantly she calls her therapist and gets a higher dose of medication. Is this a normal thing to just increases doses after one depression episode? Im a little worried because now she’s feeling terrible every day for the past few days since she increased her dose. I don’t know much about it so any help would be dandy. Thanks!
723,depression,"Felt good, as if I was dead","For someone depressed and lonely Istanbul isn’t a good place to be the city must have a big “couples only” sign on all entrances.

I was sitting next to the sea beautiful evening and I’m all alone, people passing by, and I took a ride on a very horrible train of thought. I looked around group of friends and couples all around, literally no one even glanced at me… the worst thing is it felt good, as if I was dead and my ghost was sitting there enjoying the view of the Bosphorus in uskudar my favorite place."
724,depression,"Depression and ""emotional nausea""","Do you ever have a bad episode of depression, where you're feeling so bad emotionally, your skin starts crawling and you vomit and break out in a cold sweat because you feel so terrible? Sometimes I feel like I'm being poisoned. Every time I move I feel nauseous and in pain and it's all too much, light, sounds, thoughts, the disorientation and derealization, everything. It's an awful feeling, like the mental equivalent of that thing your leg does after it's been asleep where you go to step and this jolt of electricity goes through you and everything contracts because there's too much sensation."
725,depression,I’m afraid of everything.,"Help me. I’m in tears. I’m afraid of the world. I’m afraid of the world dying, or that all of this is happening in my head, or that I’m helpless in stopping in preventing people from dying. If I lost my brother or mother...I don’t know how I could live on. My brother is now older, my mom is about to reach her 50’s. I carry so much regret that I’m missing out on my life. What if it comes soon? Or what about gamma raybursts or a rogue nuke we don’t see foming. Or being invaded by aliens through an invasion that isn’t an invasion - like they were beside us the entire time. I can’t stop these bad scary thoughts. I am at my limit-I am depressed because I realized all of this is meaningless and I am meaningless and nothing I can do can stop it. I can’t stop time, I can’t rewind I can’t prevent myself going down the wrong path. I want to believe in religion but my mind is too logical. What if I’m wrong? What if I am right tho? 
Im just scared. And helpless and hopeless.
All I ever wanted was for all of us to be together and be happy
Everyone.
We could have it.
But we are powerless.
Please any encouragement or coping mechanisms are welcomed. I’ve always had this existential fear for a long time. I want to get rid of this thinking and finally be free without worry."
726,depression,“Feeling” Abandoned,"I (23f) currently live with my parents, older sister (27f)  and grandma and my older sister can not wait to get out of this house. She absolutely hates it here but she can’t afford to move out quite yet. The reason why I get these feelings of being abandonment is cuz she’s been a source of comfort for me, like my only friend in this house. We’ve had a lot of good times together and i like to think we are friends but sometimes i don’t get the same feeling back. I know it’s really selfish of me to feel this way because she is her own person who has her own goals and needs and wants but every time we  talk about her moving out, she gives all these reasons why. Like how no one in this house is good for her, people in this house brings her down and i’m like, “am i included in that?”

I know i’m a mess (emotionally and physically - my room is always a disaster) and i can tell that my sister doesn’t like to be around me when i go through a spell. recently university had pulled me into a deep deep depression and i could tell she wanted nothing to do with me until i started to feel a little better. idk, maybe i see her as a friend and a sister while she only sees me as a sister. 

i guess i’m just afraid to be alone. i’ll feel alone without her here."
727,depression,Found out today what my anxiety medicine is,"Driving, fast, really fast. When I'm anxious or stressed, I only think about the thing I'm stressed or anxious about. So I found out that if I drive really fast on small roads etc., I have to concentrate 100% or I die. Seems like a good motivator to concentrate. 

I did it today and during that 30mins, I could breathe. If I succeed, I get to have that moment of inner peace. If I die, it's dramatic, but I also get to have eternal peace. Seems like a win-win."
728,depression,Efexor xr and not wanting to drink?,"I got the balls to go see my doctor yesterday, and he put me on the 37.5 mg efexor xr. I took it just before lunch. I normally drink about 6-8 beers a night (self medicating or whatever) and last night didn't want to drink. I had one beer with dinner, and later opened another that I didn't finish. Is this normal? I don't think I even wanted the beers I had, it was just habit."
729,depression,Online Therapy,Has anyone ever done therapy online? how does it work?
730,depression,I hate when people fake depression,I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression when I was 10 due to my past. My dad got remarried when I was 11 (im now 15)and my step brother(who was 16) fakes his depression. He went to a therapist and they said he was perfectly fine and didn't have it. He came home and said they cuerd his depression. And I knew that was bull shit 😒 but he told me I should try therapy cuz it fixes depression after one visit. I'm so done with him.
731,depression,Afraid of relapse,"I just need a place to vent. I've been struggling with depression since my pre teens, so more than 12 years now, but for the past 4 years I've been getting better and better to the point I almost don't recognize my past self. I've been so happy and dealing with stuff in a more healthy way. Quarentine has hit me hard, specially at the beginning. I was left without a job, my boyfriend lives far away and I had to go back to my parent's house. But after a while I got a hang on things.

This week has been really rough and makes me so scared of relapsing and becoming my past self. My grandma had to have heart surgery and due to covid none of us could go see her before or after. She is OK now but this really put a lot of stress in my family dinamic. My boyfriend has been planning to visit me and the plans are always interrupted by some other things, so now I really don't know when I'll see him, I never thought I would have to endure a long distance relationship until COVID. One of my best friends who lives close to me and has been my biggest support in all of this is moving to another country today. I just came back from saying our goodbyes. It's just too much."
732,depression,"i don't know how to tell my therapist that i'm suicidal, not moody","i've had 5-6 sessions with my therapist, and every time i feel like she just doesn't understand me and that her advice is not going to work. 

she told me to do some meditation when i'm feeling stressed, write down 3 things that made me happy each day, to get a better sleeping and eating schedule and spend more time with my hobbies. 

most days i can't even get to 3 things that make me happy, and it only makes me think of how little i do and it makes me feel like a failure. i can't sleep at night, and i have panic attacks after too much contact with my abusive family or just out of nowhere. i have flashbacks of traumatic memories (extremely dysfunctional family things :)  )  and no one understands me. all i do each day are my hobbies (making music, skating, cycling) and it's exhausting

2 weeks ago i was on the verge of committing suicide, i was standing by a train track while a train was approaching. i have been thinking about suicide for years. i feel like nothing works and she doesn't understand me. it's not fucking moodiness if feel sick, i wake up and the first thing i think about is that i want to die. school starts soon and i just hope that my friends will talk to me, and things might get better. but i'm scared that one day i'll lose my mind and actually kill myself."
733,depression,I wish I could heal all of us. I wish I could heal myself,"I’m tired of coming back online over and over again. Like an addict. I wish I could snap my fingers and never feel the pain again.

I wish I could keep going. Power through things.  I feel older and older. Not any younger.

I can’t go back.  I want to look ahead, but my brain whiplashes to the past.  

I wish I could lose myself into a better tomorrow. I wish I could fight more. I wish I could chill more. I wish I could be alive more."
734,depression,Idk what to do,"Ok so, I really want to kill myself rn. It’s all bc of these people I trusted blindly and told them everything. So I told them I’ve cut myself again bc of my childhood traumas ( I’ve fought a lot with my dad ) so they said “did u do it sideways or straight” , so I said “sideways ofc”. They all started laughing, I felt like crap when they laughed. So one of them said “ ur doing all of this for attention aren’t u” and that really hurt my feelings bc i tell them everything like how i feel or what i did. But then they brought up my ex ( we broke up 2 months ago ) they Said they pm’d her so i was like what did she say. So i got screenshots with her saying she didnt love me and that she had had 4 nee bf’s. And that if i died no one would care not ever my parents ( thats true bc they see all my sh cuts and dont even bother) so i Said to my friends do you even care About me. U can probably quess what they said. They said nahh tbh we felt sad for h that u had no one. At that point I knew no one would care if I left this world. I have therapists to call 24/7 bc I wanna get better but I feel like a massive burden to them. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have written a few suicide notes to all the people that were important to me. Could anyone please give advise I’m desperate."
735,depression,I feel like shit," 

I’ve honestly never felt as alone as I have the last couple of months. I have no one. For context, I’m a teenager, and I still live with my parents. They have been doing as much as they can to avoid the coronavirus, and for them that includes maximum social distancing. I can’t leave the house at all, and I haven’t for around six months. I haven’t talked to anyone but them. I’m not even allowed to get the mail. All day, everyday, I’m inside, on the couch, waiting for the day to end. My only “friends” are online and even they don’t remember I exist half the time, and if they knew me in real life they’d probably actively avoid me. 

I don’t really know what the point is. I’ve struggled a lot with self worth since I was a kid but lately I feel like absolute shit. I don’t see anything changing for a long time in my life and I know i’m probably just being overdramatic, but living like this is torturous.

I’m just so pathetic, I see other normal people having friends and I can’t help but wish I could have that. I feel like I barely exist, it seems so nice to have other people think of you. I know it’s selfish but I want someone to worry about me.

Sorry about this stupid text dump. I know no one will read this but it’s almost cathartic to post it."
736,depression,Just another waste of space (another rant again ik) but I’m spiraling so idgaf,"Went to college only to drop out from a stupid music program. Lmao I work in HR now and I’m envying doctors and nurses my age and younger who are way successful than I’ll ever be. It get so annoying hearing about their yuppie things and they’re so out of touch meanwhile here I am being invisible and overall useless to society.

738,depression,Music isn't helping anymore.,"It's starting to get bad again and this time I can't find peace in music. It's very scary to me but I am surprisingly calm about it as if I knew this will happen someday. 

Do you guys have any other thing I can use as a form of escape?"
739,depression,I dont know what I'm doing anymore and I feel like I'm not alive.,"*I'm really struggling at the moment and when i say i genuinely don't have anyone to talk to, I actually mean it. I don't have anyone. No one I know understands what goes through my head and if I do open up they think I'm being stupid. I don't exactly know what I'm living for. I don't feel happy. I'm constantly worrying what others think but I all want to do is feel something. Maybe i'll just get drunk and numb myself with that. I'm breathing but I'm not alive. I'm thinking but my thoughts are empty. I'm feeling but its feelings of emptiness. How fun right?* 

***Can someone help? Can someone stay for me? I guess not.***"
740,depression,"A bit of a vent, my apologies","Hi everyone. Hope you're all okay. I'm a 35-year-old bloke who is currently in a bit of a midlife crisis. 

I've been suffering for the last few years, slowly falling into darker depths. Some days I wake up with absolutely no energy or drive, stagnating for days doing nothing productive or useful. I'm always tired, dividing my days into two to stave off boredom &amp; exhaustion via afternoon nap. 

I've been looking at the potential autism I may suffer from. Still waiting for the results, which may be up to a year, but it would explain a lot about my awkward social anxieties. 

I left my incredibly basic job of 15 years due to my mental health, and am in the process of claiming benefits. It's likely I'll be on those for the foreseeable future, until the end. It was stressful as fuck, incredibly damaging to my mind, especially when the constant staff cutbacks felt like more &amp; more was being dumped on my shoulders. The only stable thing I had left in my existence is now gone, and along with the pandemic I literally don't go out anymore. I have no reason to. 

I've been single for 6 years now. As the years have progressed I've felt like I've spiralled downwards. I was never outgoing &amp; social, my two exes were met through online dating. The last one I left in incredibly catastrophic, disgusting circumstances, despite her being the most amazing person ever. Yet now I feel that I need some form of companionship, whether I deserve it or not. I really miss the feeling of waking up next to someone. 

My exes weren't the textbook definition of attractive, according to society. I feel that I target overweight, ""ugly"" women because they were likely to not reject me. Not only that, but they were incredibly unlikely to cheat on me; who else would have them? It's an incredibly unhealthy way for me to use someone like this. Yet I have absolutely no ability to pursue anyone deemed to be attractive or hot without being crushed by rejection or just being ignored for being nowhere near as good as other men. 

I have seen two equally 'unattractive' escorts (not for sex, mind; I'm asexual, and prefer only basic intimacy &amp; hugs, alongside some light kink activities), but feel that this is not viable going forward. It was nice to talk to them as if they were interested in me as a person, but it lacked that real soulful connection. Really, I could do with a hug right about now. 

In the last 5 years my binge-eating has skyrocketed, I've gained so much weight, and just can't stop. It's fuelling my depression, which leads to a cycle I struggle to break. My medication could possibly be doing its bit to gain additional weight also. I never liked how I looked when I was younger, but I certainly hate this fat creature I have become. I try to exercise but I struggle to keep it up, falling back into the slump each time. 

tl;dr, I'm a lonely old fat man sitting alone in his flat who has nothing to look forward to in life. No partner, no future, full of constant failure, ugly as fuck, boring, dull, antisocial. All the qualities of a great guy lol. I hate what I have become, because I don't feel like it's me, yet I don't feel like I can ever return to the good times I once had; just newspaper cuttings of my glory days.

I don't know what I want nor what to do. I feel too old to enjoy what life I still long for. Most of my family died young &amp; alone, and I feel myself slipping down the same path I tried so desperately to avoid. I guess I'm just venting, but I desperately want to escape this pit of despair, but have no energy left to climb out."
741,depression,Low motivation and energy when starting Luvox.,"Hey everyone. Been on 100mg of Luvox for about 16 days. Thoughts are quieter. Anxiety has improved and physical side effects are starting to get better. 

However, since starting Luvox / Fluvoxamine my energy levels have decreased even lower than they were before. Low mood and depression is kicking in harder and I’m not sure why this is happening? 

Perhaps these will get better with time? Maybe it needs more time to address those parts? 

Any input or anyone who can relate on the above would be appreciated. 

Thanks."
742,depression,Since quarantine I’ve been smoking weed every day,Has this been happening to anyone else? I just smoke every night when I’m done with work and do some yoga or something.
743,depression,There is no 'Happy Ever After' for me. None.,"After years of being an ugly evil shit to people and being lost within my hatred I am unsure of my life after it all. I don't know if I'll ever forgive myself for what I did to others and how I let my own personal trauma infect others. I've become the type bully that bullied me in the first place and for that I will never ever be sure if I can move past it. I think about the people I've effected every single day and I wish I could find all of them and apologize profusely until I'm out of energy.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry for turning into a monster. I no longer recognize myself in tbe mirror and haven't been able to since I was 17."
744,depression,I am horrifically ugly because of a skull deformation and want to kill myself,"I (22M) was born to two really good looking parents, my brothers got the stereotypical Mediterranean masculine pretty boy look. Me on the other hand, I got the looks too, but because of my skull shape deformation (as a baby it didn't develop right because of how I slept) my looks went from good to the polar opposite. As a young kid it wasn't as noticeable so I got attention from girls at school, but when I hit puberty, my face grew extremely long, I broke my nose twice, and I look like a mutt. I had a little kid even say 'Eww!' After seeing me in a grocery store. My head is visibly asymmetric (my actual whole cranium was slightly flattened from one side) and I just look horrible. I had jaw surgery to try and correct the bad offbite the flatspot created but it made my face look even more inconsistent. I'm still a virgin because of this. Why the fuck does life have to be so unfair? I went from looking like the child any mother would be proud to have into a pedophilic serial killer."
745,depression,Got rejected today,"Even though I have really bad depression and shit ,I still acted funny and goofy for her, maybe made her happy sometimes in my own way but she straight up rejected and ignored me ,this sucks"
746,depression,Living with mistakes is hard.,"I keep telling myself this is reality. This is what I did. But everytime I do, I try to justify what I did as right.
What I did was hurtful and too far. I don't even know if it was 100% true. I just lashed out. Had a full blown temper trantrum. I probably made her cry. Now I have to live with what I did. I am not a victim. But I keep trying to convince myself I am. Like always, i'm alone. And it's my own fault because I never learn. Now all that's left is to live with the guilt. I did this to myself. Live in silence."
747,depression,Nobody cares. If i'd disappear nobody would notice or even think anything of it,"Like who the fuck is gonna care if im not here but then not care when i am? I fucking wish i were suicidal so i could just yeet my life away and be done with the pain. I dont have a good friend and my family doesnt give 2 shits about me. I have no chemistry with my online friends because to my brain its just a slab of glass talking to me.

Im so fucking tired. I keep trying to get help and nothing works. Every fucking time. I hope to try psychedelics soon but if that doesnt work nothing will be different because my life's already trash and if its gonna get worse it'll happen slowly so i feel worse about it. Its fucking torture"
748,depression,Effexor,Anyone been on this that can tell me how it was? i was on wellbutrin for 2 weeks but started getting super itchy so my doc switched me to the 37mg of effexor. any info would be great as i’m debating whether or not to take it due to mixed reviews online. I’m mostly worried about sleep problems and sexual side effects and just overall day to day issues. Responses are much appreciated! Thanks!
749,depression,Progress,"I feel like I've made a lot of progress with the whole ""getting better"" thing. I started working on myself physically, mentally, and emotionally with a bunch of different activities and I'm working to stop smoking. There are always the days that I don't want to keep going or bad habits that wedge their way back into my life that I have been working so hard to get rid of. But I keep to my schedule and find new things to do that can help me regardless of what it is, for example fixing the bonds between me and my parents. 

A word of advice to anyone who feels like they're not getting better or feel like they're gonna slip back to where they started. Keep trying, maybe find something new that you enjoy doing or find something that sparks your interest."
750,depression,Is it okay that I have the urge to write the same thing over and over?,"I have this urge to write the same sentence over and over. My thoughts often do the same thing.

I just want to see a wall of these phrases written over and over."

I dont know what to do i just dont want to be alive anymore there is nothing left for me here. I cant sleep, i literally pass out just like in sims in random places for like 1-2 hours from exhaustion, I cry like 3-4 hours a day. I cant eat properly I cant see myself in the mirror, i did cover the mirrors it made it a little better. i cant touch myself, i am disgusted by literally touching any part of my body. i just want it to end. sorry for ranting, i have nowhere and no one to tell about it. sorry sorry sorry"

756,depression,Is this normal?,"I'm sorry for my bad English, its not my first language. I don't know if i have depression, that's why i'm here.

I'm a 17 year old kid from Norway, so basically grown up with a silver spoon up my ass. I have no big reasons for this hollow pain i'm feeling. I don't know if what i'm feeling is something hormonal, or I have some sort of mental fuck up. My hole life i'v had noting to strive for, and there in noting realistic that's out of my bounds. And because of this I feel like my whole existence is meaningless, like I don't exists for any reason. This have only gotten worse with corona. I don't eat for days, i sleep 12 to 15 hour a day. Becoming more nihilistic and suicidal by the day. Also starting to resent every thing even more, feeling like i'm bundled up with all these emotions that i only let out when i cry myself to sleep. losing interest in my hobby's and every day activities. becoming worse and worse at social contact. I don't know if this is normal and i'm just to weak and dumb to deal with it or if i should seek help."

758,depression,Don’t know how to cope after coming off my tablets,"Was prescribed Prozac just before lockdown and had therapy as well and felt good no evil thought that would pop in my head when I was alone no need for constant background noise to make me focus on something 

Anyway during lockdown my therapy stopped doing it over the phone isn’t the same as in person . But I kept taking my tablet and felt good it would stop me from spiralling deeper into those thoughts but then I started experiencing some not so nice side affect and stopped them roughly 2 weeks ago since then I’ve been becoming my old self and cutting off all social interactions the thoughts of “ it would be easier if I die” haunt me when I try to sleep or when I’m sitting alone in the quiet 

The only bit of happiness I’ve felt since I stopped was playing football with my best friend. So I phoned my doctor today and tried to get my tablets changed but I don’t know how I’m gonna deal with the next 6 weeks till the tablet kick in or longer if they don’t work the same as my last ones"
759,depression,My friend just makes me feel worse... great,"I’ve been feeling kinda stressed lately, like everything started piling up so I just snapped. And my friend just gets mad at me for being upset. 
He only made me feel worse and then he just runs away and leaves me to wallow in my own sorrow. So now I feel like shit"
760,depression,Why don't I want to see people?,"Especially people I haven't seen in a while. I'm fine going to a cousin's house or one close friend (don't have too many) and i used to be fine going to parties the rare times I would, but sometimes I just really, really don't want to.

My family said I would attend a dinner with our neighbors whose kids I havent seen since I was a young kid.

Why does it like ruin my day in anticipation? What is wrong with me? Shouldn't I be happy? Why does it feel like a big effort and I'm just tired?"
761,depression,the worst part about being depressed is when you don't feel anything at all,"Sometimes I just want to talk about ""it"" but, I don't even know what ""it"" is. It's like a dull ache that won't go away, you know it's there but you don't know what it is, or even if it's important. I often rather not speak than put people in uncomfortable situations, but sometimes I just want to go up and ask for a hug and tell them not to ask any questions. I know other people have problems too, a lot worse than mine so I just don't bother them. It's worse when you feel like no one wants to listen to you, and it's your own family. But that could just be a misunderstanding, I don't know it's just so hard when they don't know what it's like to go through some things and accidentally disregard how deeply you feel these things. But right now I just feel nothing and I think that's worse, I have no interests or motivations. When I'm depressed actually feel sad that passes more quickly and always leads to being numb, but being emotionless and putting on a mask is just sad tiring and can last for so long for me. Sorry, this is just a rant basically but it's just frustrating."
762,depression,It's 3am and I'm crying because I will never be a child again,"Summer is coming to an end and another semester at university is about to start. I always get sad around this time, I guess it's surprising to people around me that I'm still getting sad and tired of uni even though it's currently online. I won't have any free time at all once the semester starts but when I look back on this summer, I didn't really have any free time at all anyway. This summer passed and I barely even noticed it. Time is just passing by me. I was so busy with work and with trying to get things going on a uni project (didn't really get anything going, failed almost all of my goals) that I really didn't have time for a proper break. And god do I need a serious break. I'm so tired of waking up everyday and having another shitton of things to get over with. I got 2 more years at uni left. Finishing uni feels like escaping a prison in which I have been confined since I turned 7 and got into school. But then I'm realising that after I find a job after finishing uni I will probably never be free again (though I guess job wouldn't have constant homework). I feel like this past decade things just been going downhill. I so desperately want to wake up a child again. I really want to go back. When happiness was a default, when my body didn't feel like it's hurting on a daily basis and when time was passing so slowly and I was able to feel SO much. I don't feel much anymore. Not much happines for sure. I'm failing at taking in the world around me and enjoying every moment. I want to go back. I want to have time for everything again. I'm sorry for incoherent rambling but I just don't know what to do anymore and how do I regain myself."
763,depression,"I feel like I no longer like it when people say ""I trust you with doing this""","Because trust is such a damn huge responsibility. I feel like I can't be a disappointment and everything must be done right.

I’ve also been admitted earlier this year to a psych hospital. Overall, my path to healing and bettering myself has been difficult. I’ve been thinking about not taking my new meds just because I haven’t seen any real improvement? Prozac worked for me but it was short lived and soon after I ended up in the hospital. All that’s really happened is they’ve kept me from going too deep into my depression, kind of. For that I’m thankful? but I really don’t want to keep living my life like this. By “this” I mean, constantly looking for the right antidepressant. Hoping I even find one and that it’s not short lived. I’m really dreading this lifelong relationship with medications. I’ve tried the holistic approach to depression and all it’s done is made me sick from taking so many damn vitamins. Antidepressants was really the last solution I had to my depression. I’m waiting to talk about it with my psychiatrist only because I’m sure she’ll advice me against it. Am I wrong? Am I hopeless? Should I keep hope alive? Is this all my life will be? Pills and borderline depressive episodes? I guess I’m looking for advice from people who know what depression is and the struggle of finding the right antidepressant. Even just sharing what’s worked for you, I’d love to hear it. Thank you all so much."

766,depression,"Diagnosed with depression and anxiety, left by my gf a month later","I was with my girlfriend for about two years. In June, I was clinically diagnosed with bipolar depression and anxiety disorder and started therapy. I would have periods of depression, but they were nothing terrible.  a month later, my girlfriend left me. It had nothing to do with my diagnosis, she didn’t know about it.
At first she said she only wanted to take a break.  So my assumption was “ok in maybe like a month of two she’ll be better again and we can get back together.”  But I texted her a few days ago and it’s officially just over. 
I have several theories as too why I think she left me. But it’s long and complicated to explain them and really I have no reason to. 
But I always thought that we were inseparable. We were so perfect for each other. We always talked about our kids and getting married. And now I guess none of it matters.  I know that I will never find anyone who comes close to how great she was. Even in prior relationships I’ve never loved any of them like how I’ve loved her.  My one dream in life was to get a house with her one day and marry her. That’s all I ever wanted. 
I have no idea what to do with my life anymore. I am still very young, and hope that one day it will just get better but I don’t see it happening. Recently I have wanted to do nothing more than lay in bed and cry. It makes me feel so pathetic. My life will never be the same without her.  I think about her all day. I still have her photos on my wall because I don’t want to take them down.
I really don’t get it. Everything seemed so fine but until the day. She told me how much she loved me. I told her how much I loved her. She put so much work into gifts and I loved all of them. 
For some reason I’m still talking to her like we’re friends. I want to get back together with her but I know it’s not going to happen and I’m just making myself feel worse. But at the same time I don’t want to completely cut her off from my life. 
Venting through reddit seems very weird, but I have no where else I want to vent. Venting seems to take things off my mind.  I’m hoping to be put on some kind of medication. I never wanted to be on pills but I will take them for the rest of my life if I can just feel like I used to when I was with her. Also sorry if there is spelling errors in here i don’t want to go through and reread it"
767,depression,Classes start on Monday,Struggling with depression while in college has been really hard for me. Small things are are not bad like I can get myself to go to class but doing the work especially when it involves a lot of reading and researching and writing long papers is so overwhelming. I don’t care about life and I don’t have the motivation to do things. Especially now that all my classes are online I feel like it’s going to be even more difficult. This is going to be my second year in college. My grades are already awful. I’ve failed so many classes even the ones that actually interested me and that I enjoyed. If I don’t get at least a 2.0 GPA this semester I lose my financial aid which means I don’t even know if I’d be able to afford to stay in school. I think about dropping out all the time anyway. My dream in life for years has been to be a high school history teacher but I just don’t think I can handle the schooling. It’s sad to give up on something that I’m so passionate about but I think school just isn’t for me. Not everyone is made to be academics you know? I think I might just switch my career goal to being a bartender. Anyone have any advice on how to handle my schoolwork?

769,depression,"I Think My ""Ugly Duckling"" Spirit is Really Beginning to Die.","&gt;Any kind motivating words will DEFINITELY help! I've hit a brick wall in life. I want to cheer myself up by saying my biggest, deepest life dreams are not even really big at all.

**BUT.....they face a MAJOR biological killer:** `My genetic appearance in hardcore, live or die reality. And my mental health as it's alibi.` I'm currently 8 years into mental health battles. *I'm only 23.* It really hurts to lose youth like that. ~~15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,~~   All these years are EMPTY. **Major depression has set in about how if those years were so easy to be nothing, the next 8 will nothing too.**

# It feels like Darwinism is telling me to quit or something. I almost can hear it whispering to me, ""Join the dead already. Sleep is where dreams lie."" I don't know if all I ever wanted is going to even happen because of my mind and body (face).  NO MATTER HOW CLOSE I GET. I have actually ran towards atheism crying crocodile tears. Daydreamed about suicide. (Feel that coming on again real soon.) Genetic disparity and fixed appearance is not fair to the human condition. At all. If you have partial genetic code to be your dream self, you damn well should be that person. Not your nightmare.

`My heaven on Earth is simple. I swear to GOD this is what I see:`

* **Extreme levels of content and euphoria with my appearance. Almost like a vanity. Also an attractive personality/social skills.** *Far from it. I don't think my genetics, phenotype or mind will ever allow it.*
* **The dream Juliet. (Having a baby and growing old like the movie UP.)** *Ties back into the first point and last. Far from it.*
* **Being extremely talented and recognized in my two passions.** Mental health stole almost a decade of time and growth.
* **Having a financial mind to build and maintain a small net worth required to buy all my little material desires.** Mental health turned me into a disassociated sloth with a procrastination addiction and sloshed mindset.
* **Friends/Family.** My personality disorders have left me friendless since 13. And my nuclear family became sick of me for my breakdowns.

# I'm not asking for $100 Million dollars, 50 accolades, a Playboy Mansion and superstar fame, God.

# I could be homeless.......... ALL I want total happiness in the damn mirror and a squeaky clean mind. A surreal love experience. And the mental health to let me become recognized for my two passions and have killer friendships and family relation along the way for all of this.

*THAT IS ALL!*

&gt;***All I REALLY, REALLY WANT FROM LIFE is total bliss through loving the man in the mirror as ""perfect"" though. But I think genetics has F\*CKED IT ALL UP. I really do. And I'm starting to go from ugly duckling to blind.***

770,depression,I don’t know anymore,"So I was on YouTube and I was thinking about some shit and I don’t know why but I decided to turn my fan off grab my cord and proceed to tie it around my neck and went to hang myself. But I stopped my self just before I could finishing putting the cord around my fan. My neck hurts and I just fell to the ground in tears. It’s happening. I know one day I’m gonna kill myself sooner or later. Or wait Intill I hit rock botttom. I just wanna see what will happen to me. I keep saying to myself “why try anymore” “there’s no point anymore to this”. Sad thing is I believe it. All of it. I have no one and nothing my family hates me. I talk to people online but I’m just sick and tired of it. I met up with some old friends online. And played with them. They hated me but I was actually happy. For once in my life I felt like I was getting somewhere. But then I left. I don’t know why I didn’t try harder. Why didn’t I ask to make up with them and get a second chance or why didn’t I do something different in the past to make my future better.

Every night at around 1-3 am I just put on girlfriend asmr and just lay there as they say “its okay” “it will get better” I’d do this throughout the day aswell and just tell the people I’m talking with “imma go onto YouTube for a bit don’t worry about me”. There’s been this girl I was talking to online recently and she’s had it way worse I’m not gonna get into details but long story short. It’s been a rough road. I feel bad for people like her and I feel bad for the people that get bullied at school or go to work just to get home to there wife banging another guy or those who are actually going to kill them selfs. I feel bad for the people who can’t stand up and say enough is enough. 

It hurts. My neck still hurts really bad. But to be honest with you I wish I just did it. I don’t care if there’s no afterlife or it’s just darkness eternally. It’s better than having to watch those you care about get hurt. I have a friend. Very close with him and he kinda feels the same. If I wasn’t such a bitch I would help him up on his feet and get through life but I’m to weak. I can’t even pick myself up off the ground. 

Fuck it I’m just gonna spit out the truth. I just want someone there not my family or friend just I want the one. My future wife to hold me and say it’s okay I want help and I can’t get help. I’ve tried everything but nothing helps I just want to die so badly but I don’t want to hurt the others and I know my mum will be sad my sisters will miss me but I want them to live stress free without my problem I want to see everyone in my house grow up and find the one and live a happy life. My life is already over but I can’t face the truth. I’m scared i don’t want to go alone and of achieved nothing in my life. I want to die but I also don’t want to. I don’t know why I try. The only reason I’m alive is because I keep saying to myself “can’t be fucked” the reason I don’t go out or go to school “can’t be fucked” the reason I don’t try meeting new people “can’t be fucked” my birthday last year was just me in my room nothing special. I love the birthday wishes but I knew right then and there something changed. I don’t know what it was but I think I finally broke

I accepted my fate. I’ll never get a job. I’m to stupid not capable of doing anything. Just a lump. Just a waste of oxygen and nothing can help me. The only choices I have is to get lucky. Kill myself now or I wait and see what happens. 

I still don’t know if I want my “friends” to see this but it will just probably cause more problems. But if the “other me” sends this to the group chat. I just wanna say please don’t worry about me or help me. I’m done and nothing will help. I just wanna help YOU. 

If you read this thank you and hope you have a 
wonderful day :)"
771,depression,Feeling a lot of (unwarranted) deep held hatred from childhood,I know I’m the cause of all my problems. But I can’t help but blame key figures in my childhood for sending me on this path I’m on now. And that makes me hate myself even more and feel guilty.
772,depression,Afraid to immigrate to US as 25 y.o. virgin,"I am planning to immigrate to USA and now i have panic attacs that I wont be able to date as a 25 year old male virgin. There is a perception that US culture is very sexually oriented, so i panic that people will laugh at me there and mock me. If I google this topic, all articles paint the picture that virginity in your 20s is sort of defected living and a huge problem. 
I just picure that i will have to say on a first date to a girl that i have zero experience and guessing how disgusted or fooled she would feel, or whether she will just laugh at me and walk away. 
Here where i live i did not bother about it, it seems at least that there is no such social pressure. But I am afraid that in US i will be destroyed."
773,depression,Pretty depressed and lonely (sorry for the vent),"Okay, this is probably going to be a pretty exhaustive post so buckle in lol. Throughout my life I have never really had friends and that largely didn’t phase me. I enjoyed most of my childhood but it was painfully lonely. Now, lets fast forward to 2015. I met my then partner in the fall and we ended up staying together for near enough 5 years. The relationship was brilliant, but it had a painfully toxic undertone that has had horrific repercussions. One of the main examples relates to my depression. In the early days of the relationship, my ex-partner slowly began to isolate me from the few people I associated with outside of education. Pretty much every aspect of my life was controlled by her and I completely let it happen because I loved her more than I loved myself. We would do everything together, and our previous friendship circle dissipated until it was just us left. Following this I developed a pretty awful health condition that had me knocked down for a good while. I could barely leave the house and I struggled with a lot of different things. This sounds awful but during this period, I think she was the most content and happy. She never had to worry about any of the previously mentioned paranoia and I was permanently at home alone. Any suggestion relating to returning to education of looking for work when I recovered was simply dismissed and she often threatened to leave if I returned to university because she couldn’t cope with me being in that kind of environment. The only person outside of my household I came into contact with was her and this lasted for 1-1.5 years. I never had an issue with her being social, having friends or going out. However, I pretty much abstained from all of that because I couldn’t be trusted. Honestly, idk why I am writing this. I have been particularly lonely the past week. I am still struggling to make friends here in the UK and my depression has been acting up. When I systematically go through everything like this in chronological order I begin to see that I am probably better off on my own.  "
774,depression,I’m tired,"I wish I could have a life like in the fan fiction stories. Someone to take care of everything for and I could just be there for them and take care of them physically. I could just float and only have to follow a set of rules.

775,depression,Depressed while on anti depressants?,"I've been taking Fluoxetine, 60mg for about a year now, had a good recovery, but lately I've been getting worse again, eating less, sleeping more, self harming, smoking. Now I have this constant weird feeling of being depressed, but not as depressed as I should or would be without the antidepressants. It honestly makes it a bit worse, because I can't be okay and I can't be not okay, I'm in a really weird in between :/ Has anyone else experience this?"
776,depression,I'm scared,"I think I have to kill myself; I grew up with an emotionally abusive mother and a physically abusive father, i had siblings, but i always felt isolated(my sister never liked me and if i said anything my brother didn't like he would attack me) at school i was always bullied and was diagnosed with Asperger's ... Leading to more bullying.

And at some point in this mess something snapped in me, I don't know when or what but essentially the hatred took on a form of it's own, intrusive thoughts and thoughts from it; blended together and now i realise not only will i never be happy but if i was to ever start loving myself the anger will go onto someone else. I'd become like my father and mother. So I think I should probably kill myself; if I don't then I'll probably ruin someone else's life."
777,depression,Sometimes I forget how bad I'm doing and that most people don't feel like this all the time,"I feel like sometimes I forget how depressed I am and just get used to feeling so down all the time. This has been my normal for years, so why wouldn't I? It's hard to believe that there are people out in the world who don't think about death and dying all the time. People who don't wish that they could vanish from existence. People who just get up and go about their lives doing basic tasks, working, taking care of themselves, eating three meals a day... I can't imagine life without depression, or even who I would be if I didn't feel like this. 

I've been talking to my insurance company trying to get a new therapist as my old one went on maternity leave a couple months ago. While the lady and I were talking on the phone, I mentioned that I didn't think I was doing that bad, and it wasn't urgent that I see someone new. I don't want to be a burden, so whenever someone is free to talk with me is fine. She seemed surprised by this and told me that based on our five minute conversation, I didn't seem fine at all and she was really worried about me. 

This conversation has also made me question if I'm ever going to get better. I've felt like this as long as I can remember, I've done therapy, tried medication, I have hobbies and animals that I take care of, but nothing has helped. Sure, I might be slightly less depressed for a bit, but then I swing back down again. I guess I've always just gone about life because that's what you do, not because I want to or because I enjoy doing so. 

Sorry, I'm ranting and getting off the topic of this post... My mind is everywhere and I'm thinking about a lot of things right now I guess."
778,depression,All people do is make you more mentally ill,"The people you meet determine how volatile your mental illness is going to be. The more idiots you meet the more you think well why do i have to do this stupid painting bs everyday while they continue their lives.. i dont want to do this bs anymore. I rather dont do anything and sit in my own misery than attempt to be some loser that paints all day. I also dont go the gym bc i dont care and dont want to get corona. I dont see the point of anything really since people first started fcking me over. I dont condemn mass murder, some people deserve it. Some people have a reason to hate you without telling you based on how youre born. People are racist against autistic people, separate them from the rest of the population to exterminate them. All they think is you should kill yourself bc i deserve to fck these women more. Thats all they do everyday is make you feel like shit. Im going to block these people out of my life, they are toxic. How the fck does an education make you any better, youre just as dumb as anyone and most people are dumber than that. Why do you purposely make me unhappy.. i could just hit you ? If i cant get the toxicity out of my life im not going to sit and take it. You dont care if im unhappy, so dont provoke me. Yes this is a rant bc i feel like shit. I hate painting so much i dont want to do that shit all the time. I cant use my brain bc of the anxiety and depression either. This all happened to me in no time, im also uglier and fat. Such bs you meet ugly girl and for some reason getting cockblocked bs people are prudes when it fits them i hate society so much. Why do women always have sex no matter how ugly and disgusting. I became ugly in couple of years bc of the depression, and the fat is making my body deformed. Shouldve stayed in college to prevent becoming ugly and uneducated like girls. Fcking ruined my life over nothing, aint going to do this bullshit much longer. With all these dirty whores around doesnt matter if youre ugly but educated"
779,depression,I (24F) neither don't have any actual friends nor any one had never shown any romantic/sexual interest in me.,"Thank you very much if you choose to read my post since it really means a lot. However, this might going to be a lengthy post. I am average looking 24 years old female who still lives with parents (so much overprotective) and currently in my final year of college. Throughout my whole life I've never been in a relationship, never had any one shown any romantic/sexual interest in me and also at least never even hugged someone (not even a female friend since, I don't have that much closer friends). I always feel like I don't fit anywhere. Whether it's college, workplace, or any other place. I'm a little bit antisocial and have extremely limited set of 'friends'. Actually, they aren't actual friends, just people who would only interact with me for educational/work related matters.  Because of all of these, I'm extremely lonely and suffering with depression and currently in to medication. I feel suicidal at most of the time because of this extreme loneliness and my low self esteem. Sadly, I'm such a coward and  I'm too much afraid to actually attempt suicide cause I'm not sure whether my attempt will fail and I might end up in a much more miserable situation. I've already posted my situation and ask for advices on  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice) , by posting here, I'd like to seek advice on coping with depression.  I've had a too much-limited set of hobbies such as reading and watching dramas, however those things also won't excite me anymore. Now, even hearing the small sounds like clocks indicating the seconds passing (tick-tock sound), water drippings from a loosely closed tap etc.  and seeing other people being happy or just an image/photograph with a happy scenario arches my heart and whole body so much. I don't know how to describe properly that feeling via words. So, it's much harder to cope with this anymore while seeing even people younger than me moving happily with their lives while I'm stuck at this dark, never-ending tunnel, alone. I just don't see any point in living or dreaming about a non-existent future.  I'm tired of getting my hopes up for nothing always. Do any one have similar experiences? could you kindly provide any sort of advice to deal with this? Thank you very much for spending time to read my post and attempting to help.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am average looking 24 years old female. I neither don't have any actual friends nor any one had never shown any romantic/sexual interest in me. I'm suffering from depression and currently in to medication. However, just fed-up with life and seeking advice to cope with depression when each and every thing seems pointless."
780,depression,What helped you prevent waking up in the middle of the night? My sadness won’t let me sleep and I overthink.,"
I kinda have a broken heart. I don’t want to get into details, but if you have ever suffered from early awakening and feeling a deep pit of emptiness, silence, and sadness. It’s ruining my energy at work and it’s super stressful. Will sleeping pills help? I feel like life has been sucked out of me."
781,depression,I wish I could just sleep and never wake up,"I’m having a much harder day than usual today- exhausted, overwhelmed and underhelped mom of four. I just had my youngest four months ago and I love him so much- he is my pride and joy and such a sweet boy, never cries.

However, my three oldest have been in full rebellion- they are all toddlers so you can imagine how hectic my home life is.  The cleaning and tantrums are endless, sleep- I get on average about 4 hours a night and because of the variety in ages of my children a nap is extremely rare.

The father- my husband- is still in the picture and though we do love each other he works most of the time and when he’s not working he’s either in the shower (seriously sometimes he will take four a day, minimum an hour each time) or playing video games. He just got a VR so you can imagine that communication is at a minimum. He doesn’t understand why I’m so unhappy- neither do I. We have good money. A beautiful family, food in our bellies, etc.

I have full responsibility of children and household chores (he helps only when I throw a fit). I’m so tired. I feel like my older children hate me and I am having a hard time shaking the baby weight this time. I forfeit sleep to workout two hours a day- from my home, when the kids are napping- and eat only salad with lean protein. I’m not even hungry anymore. I just eat because I need to so I can nurse my LO.

I don’t feel like myself. I’m just surviving. I feel like my family deserves more even though I’m giving 200%

I don’t even know I expect to get from making this post. I guess I just needed to tell someone."

783,depression,Always the same response from the GP,"I have been feeling so exhausted all the time and have problems with my memory and concentration among other things. I had a blood test a while ago to see what was going on and the results all came back negative. I had a telephone GP appointment this morning to ask what I should do to try and feel better. I always get the same response of ""oh all of your physical symptoms are actually psychological"". The only thing that was suggested that I could do was try counselling but due to negative experiences all of the times that I have been to counselling have unfortunately been negative (won't really go into huge detail on this but what I will say is 2/3 of the counsellors that I have spoken to broke down in tears and told me that they couldn't help me any further as the things I was saying were too upsetting for them). 

I wish there were more practical solutions that I could try. I have also tried things like self care. I really want to find a support group for depression in my area but I think that they're all closed at the moment. The issue is the help available seems to be a one size fits all which isn't suited for everyone, huge wait lists and it's severely underfunded and not prioritised at all. I want to get better. I want to be able to live a normal life  and I'm willing to put in the work if an alternative to counselling was available. I am doing all I can at the moment but sometimes I need a little bit of extra help."
784,depression,I overdosed again a few nights ago. I hate myself and want to cry.,"This time I took a small handful of old antidepressants, hydroxyzine, about 30mg melatonin. My stomach hurt, I was dizzy, I felt nauseous all night and the next morning. I almost puked them up and couldn't eat for most of the next day.


I've done similar things before. Not enough to put me in the hospital, but just because I hate myself. It's really not for attention - I haven't told anyone about this instance or the past times I've done it. It's not to die, because I have effective ways to die in the house already.


I just want to cry. I wish the pain would stop, but I'm too chicken to attempt suicide again."
785,depression,Week 3 of Zoloft.,"Is this normal?

I’m on 50mg and this is day 15, I’m feeling so tired and have literally no energy. I’m laying in bed most of the time, I do get bursts of energy that last an hour or two where I’m able to get some things done. 

Is it normal to be feeling this way? I was on Zoloft once before but it was about 7 years ago and I honestly didn’t notice any side effects, I felt good on Zoloft. 

Now I feel like physically depressed, my mind isn’t in a very bad place - I’m not laying around because I’m sad. I’m laying around because I literally don’t have the physical energy to do anything else. 

Is my dose too low or do I just need to ride this out longer and I’ll get feeling better?"

I feel like it's time to order up about a gram of pure fentanyl and shoot it straight into my vein. I used to be a junkie, so I know how to operate a syringe.

790,depression,Weird thoughts about suicide,"
 I hope this is posted in the right subreddit. I don’t necessarily suffer from depression as far as I know, I am very excited about my future and do everything I can to get into the university I want. Although these thoughts haunt me every day, they make me question myself, if I’ll ever be good enough to live the life I want to.

 I think about dying and my social life. I have friends that I love but I know for a fact that I am no one’s ”number one” friend if that makes sense. It’s truly awful knowing that. I know some people and friends look down upon me for my past, through my teens I was socially awkward and that picture of me won’t go away anytime soon. I think about this to the point that I just want to distance myself from everyone and be alone, or start over. That’s when the suicidal thoughts begin and it’s hard to just shake it off. Obviously I don’t want to die, nor would I ever commit suicide or hurt myself, it’s just thoughts. Thoughts followed by ”would people even care if I disappeared?” Etc. 

 I wish I could talk to someone about this but it’s really difficult. Even writing it out is hard enough. I’ve tried before but it doesn’t come out the way I want it to, and to be honest I doubt anyone gives a fuck. 

Has anyone else had thoughts similar to this? How would you deal with it?"
791,depression,More nothing,Im caught in the tides of my own emotions. In some ways it may be more accurate to describe it as a tidal wave. Im lost in the maelstrom.

Im broken in a lot of ways and with each attempt i make to come out of this hole i am met with.....more emptiness.

I get it, and I give up wishing you'd turn up. Give up hoping that you think of me even a little. I give up. You've moved on. And I should too I guess.."

797,depression,Can anyone help guide me on steps to starting therapy?,"Hopefully this one of of the right subs to post this in. 

At this point all I know is, I don’t want to feel like this anymore and I’ve accepted I’m not able to solve my problems on my own or with the help/support of others in my life, I’m tired of using my only 2 friends left as a crutch and venting to them. Of course the pandemic has exacerbated everything but this was something I wanted to do around this time last year as well but never followed through with because I get so unbelievably overwhelmed trying to start the process and following through with it. 

I feel like I need someone to tell me Exactly what to do and kind of reassure me, I got this? I’ve already made the first couple steps, I think I’ve identified MOST of what I’m wanting to work on in therapy. I just don’t know where to start with finding one, finding out if I can even afford it, etc. Do I try a psychologist or psychiatrist? What’s the difference? Is one more affordable? This is the point where I usually start to spiral. Any help is appreciated."
798,depression,I’m only posting on here so I can sleep.,"I heard that loneliness is something that you can take care of yourself, but I don’t want to live alone anymore. I’ve just been feeling like why bother even being alive if everyone’s gonna misunderstand you or treat you like you aren’t worth their time. I know there’s been times when I haven’t always treated people well, but I was super depressed and their neediness or negative emotion was making my negativity expand even more. Why the fuck would they yell at me and expect me not to be pissed at them for that?"
799,depression,Anxiety tips you might not have heard of,"Hello,

I've had crippling anxiety on and off for many years and I have developed coping tools that has helped me alot. This Mostly is for people who have GAD and panic disorders but can help for almost everyone.

1. When you notice anxiety is rising be mindful.

Okay. I've heard this sooo often without much practical explanation so I will try and explain how I use it. 

In the past. Whenever I felt the rising feeling of anxiety it almost instantly spiraled into a panic. It happened so fast that it became an untamely beast. However, during one event I sensed the feeling of anxiety and instead of reacting to it, I really REALY focused on the sensation it was creating. Once you cut off the reacting you cut off the fuel to the fire.

Now I know what you're thinking, ""that's easy for you to say, my anxiety is so bad I can't stop to examine it"". I know how you feel, I've been there many times. The thing is, no matter how bad you anxiety is it always starts from a initial sensation. 

Once you focus on that sensation, you start to understand the driving force that fuels the fire. For example, before, I would just say I'm panicking and then I would freak out. Now, I can notice the first sensations as: vertigo/ tunnel vision, flushing of the skin, and even more subtle sensations that are hard to describe (I'll give it a try). The subtle feelings are: a sense of ramping up (kinda like an electrical excitement), brain static (similar to dizziness but a slight buzzing sensation) 

Now everyone is different, so just start to practice bringing your attention to what your anxiety feels like.

2. Accept all the unpleasant feelings.

Don't even label it as unpleasant. Just be completely neutral to the sensations. Again, easier said than done. When you can Except everything as ""it is what it is"" mentality you cut the fuel line of the anxiety roller coaster.

3. Get fucking psyched.

Now if you are in a full on panic attack. You just can't expect everything as it is. Your brain is in full on ""I'm going to die mode"". At this point, get pumped. Get excited for the panic. Pretend you're Goku powering himself up right before taking on Majin Buu. You trick your brain into realizing that there actually isn't a threat at all.

Additional tips that help. 

1. Masterbate.

This one is probably you haven't read. You can't feel pleasure and fear at the same time. You just can't. If you you have a consenting partner, have her/ him help.

2. Drink water very slowly. 

This is a pretty common tip, but if you don't know, drinking anything causes your autonomic system to kick back. This can help bring your heart rate down and slow your breathing.

3. Put ice on your forehead.

This one is weird, but for some reason the shock of cold kinda snaps me outta the panic. Also a cold shower helps too.

That's all I have for now. But feel free to add to this in the comments if you have some weird tricks that help. If this helps one person who reads, then it will all be worth it."
800,depression,"My life is a movie, and I’m closing in on the credits","I’m honestly pretty uncomfortable even posting this here, but I don’t know what else to do. Maybe someone can relate to me. I wake up in the morning unhappy with myself and the way i effect the world around me, I second guess all my friendships and relationships, so it’s hard for me to keep people in my life for any reasonable amount of time without making them fed up with my bullshit. I feel alone even when I’m in large groups of people, I’ve tried meds, alcohol, maybe I’ll try opiates. At least that way I get a little bliss until I eventually overdose. I don’t know what to do I’m not quite ready to die but I’m watching myself go down this path of self destruction. I’m 17 but I doubt I’m making it past 25. Maybe even earlier if I can’t find a way to heal myself."
801,depression,Still walking before the sun rises.,"Still walking at night. The hobos peak out from along the channel, through gaps in their tents and from under draped blankets. When I wave they disappear. A few know me, but they often move on to some other unknown portage.

There are more homeless now as there was a large fire in my area. People just gave up after they lost their homes, prized possessions, or family members. I can't blame them. Their loss is tangible. The homeless are different from the hobos. The hobos are traveling oddities, strange creatures ill suited to the world. The homeless rage in the night, they wail and cry spontaneously, and they poison themselves in the most creative ways.

Walking, walking, walking. No sensation of body or footfalls. The world slides by alongside thoughts, nothing to grip, nothing to hold on to. Let it slide. Let the night carry on. Wave to the hobos. Sleep when the sun chases away the ghosts."
802,depression,There isn’t enough good and happiness in life to make it worth living,"I’m so depressed. Even when I’m “happy” I’m just reminded by how fleeting this feeling is, and that for the most part, life is monotonous and boring. I’m bored with life. Every conversation is just the same. Everyone is predictable."
803,depression,I feel like I annoy everyone..,I feel like I annoy everyone in my life. What is the point of living if I just annoy everyone?
804,depression,Thinking about quitting therapy,"Hey guys! I have chronic depression and I started doing therapy in last October. I do it once a week since I’ve began, but sometimes I’m so hopeless that I want to quit it. Sometimes I feel like I’m bothering even my therapist with my bs. I like her, and it took a long time for me to find the right therapist and maybe she’ll have to leave the hospital and I’ll have to find another one... but I don’t feel comfortable with having to share everything about my life again lol 

Anyone ever had the same feeling?"
805,depression,I want to cry and I can't.,"Lately I really want to explode, but I can't.

I don't do it because I think I shouldn't do it, I have responsibilities and I can't stop my life, and I personally dislike writing this kind of thing or commenting on it because I don't want to get people's attention, I understand that there are many people out there dealing with their own issues but lately I am putting away my sad emotions and they are really getting to me. But not being able to ""get them out"" is making everything worse and I sincerely want to do it, to relieve myself.

I feel strange, because there is a need in me to throw that stone that is on my shoulders, it is not that I am sad about something specific, it is simply an accumulation of many situations that are drowning me.

So I ask here for some advice to take the first step, I do not live alone and I do not want that when I leave my room I have to appear a kind face just so as not to worry others, but honestly, I don't want consolation either, I just want to be able to free myself ."
806,depression,Tired,"I’m tired of this... I’m tired of living like nothing is wrong. That I always have to put a smile on. That I’m a man and that men just have to suck it up and move forward. 

I spent an hour today trying to unpack the last three years of my life. I’m just now starting to realize that the real part of me died on March 6th 2017. That everything i have tried to do has been for other people. I wake up every morning expecting to be used by someone else for something. None of them really care about me.

I am alone, I think I’ve always been alone. Whatever part of me that was still living died three years ago. It’s taken me three years to realize I’m just rotting. The stench is becoming unbearable, and nobody else notices the smell. I guess it’s what I deserve, I just have to wait for another carrion bird to finish off what’s left of me."
807,depression,Can’t stop smoking weed and ordering pizzas and drinking energy drinks,"I have so many bad habits and I feel stuck. I have no motivation to stop and I can’t even go a single day practicing good habits all around. I just recently started brushing my teeth before bed again which I guess is an improvement, but I always have the uncontrollable compulsion to drink energy drinks at work and to smoke weed and order pizza in my free time. I don’t make my own food..it all is takeout. It’s pathetic. I don’t know how to get this under control. I feel trapped."
808,depression,This is the peak right?,"Does it get worse? Can I just stop feeling? I want to be numb. Why can't I die in my sleep, that sounds peaceful.

810,depression,I really need someone to talk to,"I just turned 15 and my life has always been really shitty. I have 3 brothers and im the middle child. I used to be youngest till i was 7 when my parents gave birth to my younger brother and 2 years later, they gave birth to the youngest brother. After they were born, my life just went downhill. My parents would usually neglect my achievements and would always scold me for what i did wrong. I know that that is normal for most middle childs but seriously i think that they actually dislike me from the beginning that why they had 2 more children. Just recently, my parents are having financial problems and we had to move back to our homeland (Phillipines) and they are planning to bring us to canada this year. This made me really upset cus ive been growing up for 13 years in Singapore and that i got so used to the culture there that i feel like i wouldnt be able to interact with anyone in a another country. I have to say that if it wasnt for my 2 younger brothers, i would still be in Singapore rn. Other than that, my parents are very toxic and making me feel like a piece of shit over simple things until the point everytime they would ask me something, i would just either ignore them, complain or just argue with them. I always tried my best to make them feel happy and proud of me for helping them in errands and stuff. But they would always take me for granted and still call me names. Ik that they might be stressed out and whatever but they would never treat me like their my son and they would always compare me with other kids and how they always help theyre kids with out complaining and shit but seriously i did exactly what their ""dream son"" would do for them but they still wouldnt treat me like they love me. Fyi im also a catholic and everynight i would pray for my family to become better people and im starting to feel like as if god is in their side and non of my prayers are even being answered at all. I never ever opened up my feelings to my family because to them, being depressed, sad and suicidal are for weak people and u just need to be ""happy"". The thing is, the reason why theyre happy is because theyre the ones who are making others sad and are insensitive of other peoples feelings. I get suicidal thoughts everynight but i would always wish it would get better but it seems to be worsening. Im really sick and fucking tired of all the insulting comments and bullshit theyve said to me and feeling unloved in this shitty and biased family that i feel like i dont even matter to them anymore. I really question why life is like this and why am i born in this family. 
And with that i hope that everyone is doing well during this time of the pandemic"
811,depression,I'm over life,"I've been dealing with depression/anxiety for over 20 years and I'm barely gonna turn 30 in a few weeks. Along with depression and anxiety, I also have PTSD, which in my opinion is the worst one. I have a back story that's probably not very surprising. I grew up in a household where I was abused, my mom was obsessive with her husband who abused me, I binge ate to hide the trauma, etc. Anyway, that pretty much ruined my life. I've done a lot to help myself. I've been in therapy for years now lost the weight, stopped binge eating, went to school, got a job, etc. I considered all that to be ""moving on"" with my life. However, I am still not happy and feel like I'm chronically on survival mode. I developed Hypochondria during the last few years, and interestingly enough I didn't really believe in that too much until I got it, of course. I've also been dealing with a very painful chronic illness for over half my life, that makes me wish I was dead/dying instead of just going through a flare up. It's been a loooong time since I've felt truly happy, excited, etc... most of the time it's a toss up between anxious, depressed or blah. I don't want or need sympathy, but I just don't really get the point of living this way, and its just nice to be able to admit it to other people."
812,depression,Seems like when you try to be nice to others bad things happen...,I’ve  always been nice to someone but they always get annoyed to the point were I just don’t talk to people anymore.

815,depression,6 fucking cavaties and a $800 bill thanks to meds,"When I started meds I stopped drinking, and my drink cravings turned into sweet cravings. Add in new dry mouth and 2 months later I have 6 little cavities forming. I havnt had one in like 10 years. Everytime I try to take care of myself I get unintended consequences that fuck me up even worse. I already hate the dentist, im not sure if im more upset about the money or the hours of drilling. Fucking hopeless."
816,depression,And on and on and on and on and,"Sometimes I feel like Im going to be depressed forever and then within that same thought I think maybe I'm not depressed at all? Maybe this is happiness and I don't know how to recognise it? Or that I'm trying to make myself appear more complex by claiming to have depression? 

I just don't see why I can't snap out of it? Somtimes I'm keeping up with life (going to the gym, eating right, socialising) and then I feel overwhelmed but then if I do nothing I'm just letting time pass by and lying in bed feeling guilty"
817,depression,"Oh no, it's coming back. The urge of cutting myself is coming back again, stronger than ever.","Summer vacation is almost over. It is the time for school. In my country they had the virus under control, so they started school. I feel like total shit right now and I really want to cut myself. The only thing that's preventing me from doing it is because I don't have shirts with long sleeves to hide them.

A year ago I had a argument with my mother, and we haven't talked or met each other ever since. If that wasn't mentally draining enough for a child like me, school that year hit like a truck. Teachers were yelling at me, I was lonely, depressed,... all that stuff. It was the worse year of school for me. Now I am afraid of it happening again. One more time. One more time my so-called friends judge me, avoid me and I will fucking explode. 

I have the personality of being calm and collective. Apparently other people my age is too childish. It is cocky to say that, but I just can't stand it anymore. At least in my school, when I want to be alone to study, there will be swear words being thrown across the classroom. They fight over stupid things. They talk smack behind other people's back.
And as a leader, I have to take the blame. Whatever the fuck my classmates do, I have to withstand all of the consequences. 
There were no weeks that my wrist was not bleeding. The amount of stress was incredible, even I was surprised by it. So I am very afraid of going back to school.

Sorry if you don't like swearing. I was really frustrated.

TL;DR: I am afraid of going back to school to face my classmates. I wanted to cut myself again. I need advice or else I might die because of loneliness."
818,depression,Getting depressed because boyfriend actions,"He is acting like baby for visa payment I delayed and is always nagging for it lately.

821,depression,Should I go to my school’s ball? I’m in my last year of high school,"So my school is having a ball for the year 11’s and 12’s on the 15th of September and I’m wondering if I should go or not. I went last year and didn’t enjoy it, I sat at my table alone while everyone else danced with their partners. Since of COVID, there’s no dancing this year so everyone will just sit at their tables for 3 hours, apparently there’s things to do that the seniors committee is planning but I feel like it would be boring for me. 

My reasons for not wanting to go is because I’m on the ‘outside’ of my friend group, I don’t get invited to things they have on the weekends/holidays. Same as last year, I don’t have a partner so I’d just be sitting there with people that don’t like me for 3 hours. My crush is also there as well, but she’s on another table with her friends and she doesn’t care about me either.

Then there’s the cost of going which is 80 dollars, and people have made plans to have after parties as where I live, bars and nightclub have opened again and I haven’t been invited to anything.

So yeah, either I go to the ball and probably be bored and sad for 3 hours or stay at home and do nothing as usual.
Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this."
822,depression,Social Connections,"(Side note, I've been thinking for around 10 minutes, including some research into terminology, before settling on this title, which is already at least one show of insecurity)

About 5 years ago, on the verge of ending it all, I finally started treatment for depression. I took medication, and for a few blessed months felt alive, better than I've felt in years. I started developing connections, even had my first girlfriend, which a few years later became my wife. Nothing could be better.

But something broke. All the friends started disappearing, the connections broke, and not a day goes by without me wondering if I even want to be married, or if I even want to be alive.  I do not think it's her fault, but I blame this regression on her. It feels like she systematically broke any friendship I had, though that is probably not the case. Now every request she makes turns me furious, and every complain or worry hateful, and I bottle it all up, because I can't share my emotions, and because if I leave now I really have nowhere to go and no one else. I don't even have enough money for my own place.

For the past two years every psychiatrist visit ended up in a slightly increased med dosage, and slightly decreased hope for the future. The days of being honest and open about my feelings are past, I can't even look my wife in the eyes and tell her how I feel. She senses that, even asks me if she is the reason I'm not happy. I just lie every time.

And honestly, I have no idea what I want. Do I want a different relationship, or just some friends? I don't know how much of it is the male part of me, and how much the desperation, but I start fantasizing about how my life and relationship would be with pretty much any woman I could even have the slightest interest in, without knowing anything about her (I do not believe I learned anything about anyone but my wife in at least the last couple of years).

I'm starting another round of psychological treatment on Monday, though I'm pretty skeptic about these already. I honestly don't know what I expect, I just needed somewhere to vent off..."
823,depression,I can’t,"The thought of only being 18 right now and possibly being able to live till I’m 50 stresses me out. I don’t even wanna be alive right now. The shit I could learn now about adulting will change so much by the time I get to 25 and I’m gonna have to relearn all of that all over again and I just can’t.

I can’t drive at all. I barely understand the shit at my job. I haven’t done taxes at all. I don’t know anything about life insurance, dental insurance, medical insurance, car insurance.

I dont have any friends. I can’t even feed myself right. I just eat out 24/7 and that leads to me having stomach pains and throwing up everything I eat. People can literally eat McDonald’s and be happy &amp; when I try and eat out I can’t handle it. I can’t drown my emotions in food. I’m allergic to cats and dogs so I can’t have a pet. I don’t have any friends. I’m just tired of being alive. Too much responsibility that I didn’t ask to have. I swear I’m gonna kill myself one day I just don’t know when"
824,depression,Can't stop thinking about the fact,That she stopped talking to me and a year later spilled that it was because she got a boyfriend and didn't need me anymore. Like.

825,depression,"I finally got a new job again and I should feel happier, but I just feel so much worse.","-Small trigger warning in second and third paragraphs, (mention of SH/scars) obligatory I'm on mobile so apologies if formatting is stinky-

I (f17) finally got a job again after I lost my last one in mid March because of the pandemic. Its kind of fun, the people there are awesome and the job itself is something I'm good at and doesn't trigger my social anxiety or panic/anxiety disorders as much as I thought it would due to the industry (food service).

But I'm just not happy. I have a rocky relationship with my parents and family (who I live with), two of the three people I thought were my closest friends don't actually care about me as much as I care about them while the third one just moved to a different state, I recently came out as bisexual and most of my extended family who I love dearly won't even talk to me anymore. On the plus side though, I have an absolutely amazing boyfriend of almost 6 months who is everything to me, I'm losing weight at a good rate, my studies are becoming easy for me and no longer give me panic attacks, and the scars on my thighs are fading well.

Frankly my life lies right in-between the kinda sucks and pretty okay marks. I'm trying to find the silver lining in the bad stuff but even the good stuff is getting rough. My boyfriend and I are starting to have issues, the pandemic is making my studies more sporadic and difficult to follow, and I'm fighting to stay clean. Even my job is more physically demanding than I thought and one of the managers just gives me bad vibes, and three people all quit at once recently and nobody really knows why.

Its just hard to really find reasons to be happy anymore when normally I'm fairly okay."

I don’t want to say I’m giving up because I’ve tried saying that before but everything I do right not feels pointless.

830,depression,How my life feel apart within 2 years,"I'd like to apologize up front for bad grammar or any typos. 

I started high school around 3 years ago. I was gonna study the law, I had a bunch of friends in my class that I knew since kindergarten. My friends introduced me to their friends so I pretty much knew most of the people in our school. I did sports and I was a fairly good looking guy who knew a lot of people so that made me somewhat ""popular"" I guess. 

There was a few girls that tried flirting with me but I never really liked ""bad girls"" (basically girls that party too often and change their bfs one a month) so that didn't work out. Halfway through my 1st year I met the girl that I thought I'd spend my entire life with (kinda pathetic of me to assume that now that I think back on it). The rest of my 1st year went smoothly, got good grades, made more friends etc.

When summertime came I basically spent the entire day of my break with my gf. We went on a bunch of dates, slept together. The usual stuff that people our age would do pretty much. After some time her insecurities started to come out, she got jealous when I spoke to my friends (not just girls, friends in general) and since I was so madly in love with her I agreed to limit my contact with them a bit which just lead to me loosing around 95% of my friends. I got depressed and put on weight and when the second schoolyear started I was so ashamed of what I did to myself that I changed schools. My depression just got worse and I never told my gf bcs I didn't want her to blame herself and that created arguments between me and my parents which only lead to me and my family falling apart from each other. 

Around a year ago I learned that my father isn't my biological father. I reached out to my biological father and he said that I was the biggest mistake in his life and that he never wants to know me. In my head that kinda made sense. As my mother explained, he only ""made"" me so that my mom wouldn't leave him but she did anyway because he was and still is a very selfish person that would only have ruined my and my moms lives. So like I truly am and feel like a ""mistake"". 

The news about my father only added onto my depression and while I was dealing with that my gf decided that she doesn't love me anymore and that she wants to break up. That completely broke me because she was the only person that was here for me and comforted me. My family saw how broken I became and they tried ""helping"" but it didn't really help. The only time I truly told them how I felt was when I got drunk on a holiday trip that the family had together after my birthday. My family talked me into talking with a specialist which I did but that didn't really help and she didn't really want to prescribe me any meds because I'm too young in her eyes (I'm 19 for the sake on context). 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I focus on my studies and work out everyday. I have lost weight (still got some way to go until I'm where I want to be) but I'm still in a pretty dark place mentally and I don't really know how much more I can take before I snap. I have a few friends that I talk to online and I'm gonna visit one of them soon but except for that I'm pretty alone irl. Sometimes I feel like I don't even want to feel good anymore and that I deserve to feel this way because I let my life fall apart like this."
831,depression,Good days and bad moments,"Good days and bad moments.  After a career of preaching to those I led that as long as you are breathing, you are having a good day and there are no bad days, only bad moments... I find my words are easier to preach than to live by. 

Life is a struggle, at times.  I find myself missing what I once had.  But, life is about change. Nothing ever stays the same.  My only hope is that the days to come make the present nothing more than a small bump in the road.  Maybe I’ll learn to appreciate the smaller things when they happen.  Maybe I’ll learn to cherish what I have, not covet what I don’t.  Maybe this is all a test.  Hope is a powerful word... maybe I’ll learn to actually embrace the word with a positive outlook. 

One step at a time."
832,depression,i don't know what to do,"For the past month I've been staying up all night going to bed around 6-8 am. i am so tired/exhausted , my brain pulsates with pain and all i do is stay in my room. 

i don't know the cause of it.

my girlfriend keeps threatening to leave me, my parents split up last week, lost 3 of my closest friends , no direction in life, dropped out of school, i just don't know what to do anymore. i recently turned 18 and i just don't want to anymore."
833,depression,i feel like no one in my life actually likes me,i’m bad at maintaining relationships with other people. i feel so distant from everyone in my life. i deleted all my contacts and social media because i don’t talk to anyone anymore. this is my fault i wish i socialized with people more but i’m shy. also i’m unemployed and i don’t have any hobbies anymore so i really have nothing to look forward to in my life.
834,depression,I dreamt that I committed suicide and was watching the aftermath of it unfold,"This dream really shook me up, especially after attempting in February. I thought I had gotten over it, but maybe it's more so repressed. It was so bizzare, watching my mother in my dream hysterical about me, but I didn't feel remorseful or pity. I literally dreamt about my own funeral arrangements and I really can't fucking believe it. When I woke up there were tears rolling down my face. I'm not upset about the dream, I just find it so weird and trying to find some type of explanation.

Ever since the dream I have found that I have been slipping back, mentally speaking. I guess it really shook me"
835,depression,Is depression truly curable?,"Up until a few years ago, I was almost happy for a while.  I just lived everyday doing what I wanted to and didn’t think about the future.  It was the first time since I was a kid that I felt almost normal. Then on my 24th birthday it hit me that I was getting old and I was still here, I needed to make something of myself.
What has followed has been years of crushing guilt and shame that seems to follow me everywhere. I’ve tried studying (three times), joining employment agencies, volunteering, accessing mental health services, joining classes, meditating etc. but nothing ever works out.  I keep slipping and I’ve tried so hard to get out of this hole, I’m tired. I wouldn’t know myself without depression or anxiety it’s always been a part of me and most likely always will be."
836,depression,Please I need your guy's help,"""today's a shitty day and my dad got mad at me twice.  i hate today.  and there will be many more today's that will come.  i don't want that"" was what my friend posted on our friend group chat. Please I need advice, It's alright if you don't want to. But please I don't want her kill herself."
837,depression,Not sure how to go on on anymore,"A lot of stuff has been going on I’ve been diagnosed with depression since I was 16 now 21 a college senior and it just seems to be getting worse and worse. I lost my gf, lost majority of the family because they don’t want to be around me anymore I try to get help but it just not helping at all. Not sure what else I can do. College has been a distraction for me as much as I can be but once this years over not sure what’s going to happen. Any advice?"
838,depression,How can I tell how what I'm feeling is depression and not me wanting attention,I have felt suicidal since I was 8 and I'm currently 14 and I just got the sudden urge to cut myself. I have told people that I suffer from depression but I have not been diagnosed. I have done multiple online tests that diagnosed with severe depression but I feel in the back of my mind that I'm just doing this for attention even though what feeling is real. I haven't told anyone in my family and I don't want to just yet. What can I do?
839,depression,[trigger warning] I just can't anymore and nothing and no one helps,"I am 29 years old and chronically depressed. Sometimes it is doable, but often I am suicidal. Also I always have suicidal ideation.

I have traumas from the past due to struggling being mainstreamed and bullied and just struggling in living because I have autism and severe to profound hearing loss.

I have been in therapy for six years now, I have one session every week. The first institution referred me to another institution because they weren't capable of giving me the care I need. The current institution however, is very strict in taking a one size fits all approach. I have weekly sessions but many subjects are cut off because of lack of time, and the treatment method is CBT. I have to fill in those forms with thoughts and alternative thoughts but it is so frustrating because I can't do it. My therapist says it can take a long time and it is part of the process. However, in the first institution they stopped this approach because I have rigid thoughts because of autism and it just didn't work.

Saying it is a long process that needs time, I understand, but for me it is like being in a house burning down and people saying: don't worry, the fire service is coming tomorrow.

I have said many times I want to die, but people say: no that's such a shame, and you will hurt people around you.
I know, but I hurt myself by staying alive for others.
The only two issues are:
- I haven't found a 100% guarantee method yet
- I have a dog, whom I love more than anything. There will sure be someone taking good care of her, but she will miss me I am afraid, because she is always with me

I am angry that there are no good mental health care methods. Where I am there are only two options: 1 session weekly maximum for outpatient care (which I have now) or clinical inpatient treatment which is not suitable for me because I struggle in different environments and adapting to change is so hard and I have severe social anxiety"
840,depression,Help,"It’s 2 AM and I haven’t started college apps or school work at all. I’ve been saying “today i stop procrastinating” for years knowing full well how easy life would be for me if I simply put in any amount of effort into it. It’s so mentally taxing knowing I have to maintain a standard, and every time the thought of dying (car crash, sickness, anything out of my control) seems so comforting. A tragic death where people remember me by what I could have done in the future rather than having the possibility of disappointing those I care about."
841,depression,Post woke depression,"After learning about everything from UN 2030 , new world order, agenda 21 etc ive developed a hardcore sadness and depression and i kinda feel like hopeless and that everythibgs been ruined for me"
842,depression,The main source of my depression is poverty.,"Story of my life so far. First be born into poor family. Childhood was ok since everybody is nice to you and the world is new. Maybe a few suicidal thoughts here and there from ages 3-5. Then school comes. Kids notice how you have shitty things and are fat because unhealthy foods are more affordable and being poor is stressful and causes you to eat more to feel better. You turn down invitations to go to the movies or play online games, to socialize and improve friendships because you don’t have the money or computer to do those things. 

Ask multiple crushes out but get turned down since your one of the the poor and fat kids. Lowered self esteem. Gives up on asking people out. Eating more to deal with more stress. Diabetes. Depression. Family problems. Being bullied for being the fat loser kid who has lame friends. Gets in trouble for being bullied. As time goes on people do more things while you have to get a job to be able to do some of the things with friends. Physically and emotionally drained. Then college. Pressured to go to college. Buys first laptop. Go into insane debt. Still working while others do more social things. Debt always looming in back of mind. Gives up on life. 

Job search takes a year for a job people without a degree can join. Self esteem nonexistent. Continues to eat the stress away. Debt grows. Too fat to work outside of home. Finds a work from home job. Debt seemingly unable to be paid off. Friends in the same boat decides to end it. Some die, some in jail, some on drugs, some don’t work. Becoming jealous of friends. Can’t leave house often. Cost of being alive is too high. Regrets life decisions. College not for me. Being poor not for me. This life not for me. Drinking. Lots of drinking. Afraid to use drugs and become addicted. Alcoholic. Starts to lose weight because of covid. Starts to lose weight because of less eating and more alcohol. Makes this post"
843,depression,Just talking to the void,"I dont have anyone I can tell my thoughts to. My true feelings. No one can handle it or listen to it. They get frustrated, scared, annoyed, depressed, helpless,  or angry talking to me. And I end up comforting them instead of them helping me. So im sharing my thoughts here. 

My day was going fine. Im packing up to go back to college this weekend. But then I was reminded of my ex. My ex of two, almost three years ago now. But it still feels just like yesterday. It still hurts so bad. Im so lonely without him. I truly loved him. And now... he's gone, with no chance of us ever reconciling.

I want to get over him. But I can't. Ive been treading water ever since he left me. I've done all the right things. Working out, fixing my diet, succeeding in school, working an online job, taking care of myself. But I still feel so empty. Things are OK. But I'm not happy. I've never felt joy the way I did with him. I'm afraid I never will again.

Doing well in school, losing weight, accomplishing things - they don't bring me joy. I feel like less of a loser for doing something with my day, but thats about it. Im going to school so I can do more school so I can slave at a job for the rest of my life. Im financially set already. I know I'll be able to achieve the things I want. But I doubt I'll ever be truly happy. I only feel that way when im spending time with people I enjoy and love - but I don't get that feeling from anyone anymore.

Being around what few friends I have left is exhausting more than anything else. I have to pretend to be someone im not. I cant be depressed. And the more I show them my depression, the less they want to be around me. So I dont feel accepted or loved by anyone. 

I spend all of my time trying not to think about the past, and how much trauma and hurt I suffered. I play video games and watch videos almost constantly just to keep the thoughts out. And most of the time, it works. But today, it didn't. I feel like i got sucker punched in the throat. Like all of the life has rushed out of me, like a deflated balloon. 

I always hear that i have to love myself before anyone can love me. But I hate living life alone. All of these things im doing - dont bring me any meaning or happiness. They just keep me busy so I don't have to think. Ive practically given up trying to cure my depression. I've thought every thought, tried almost every technique money can buy, gone to multiple therapists. Its all never done anything. The only thing that alleviated the pain was feeling loved by someone else. He made life feel worth living. Now, i only live because i can't die. Im not suicidal, but if i could erase my existence without anyone ever having known me... I'd probably take it. 

Its fine if no one reads this or cares. But if you do respond, thanks. Please follow the sub rules and comment on this post - do not DM me. I will block and ignore you. Thanks to anyone who made it this far."
844,depression,"Cotard has been especially terrible for the last two months, and I feel bad for my friend that's helping me.","With my specific [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotard_delusion), as well as the feeling of being dead, I also deal with feeling as if my blood isn't in my body and that my heart doesn't beat because of that, and I also deal with severe dissociative episodes and can get very physically violent with myself during these episodes. I have a friend that helps me cope with it. She'll talk to me and keep me ""here"" when I dissociate and I'll also give her anything I'd use to hurt myself to prevent that since I can't trust myself to just get rid of it, like a knife or the glass speaker I broke. The thing that bothers me though is that my mind is telling me that I'm holding her back. Like... What if she has plans, but then has to cancel because of me? She told me that hasn't happened and wouldn't be upset if it did. But what if she's saying that just to be nice? I don't like thinking I could be preventing her from something."

847,depression,Help - Does depression give her the right to continuously hurt me emotionally?,"My wife has diagnosed bipolar as well as depression. Every few days she says that she is not attracted to me and that she doesn’t know if we’re in a healthy marriage and that she doesn’t think she loves me anymore. Then after her episode of depression or bipolar, she apologizes, saying that she loves me deeply.

And the cycle repeats. And repeats. And on and on and on. 

I am so drained, so crushed and so numb. I do not feel loved at all. 

As somebody who does not have depression, I want to know: does her having depression give her the right to hurt me so? Am I supposed to just sit there and take this emotional abuse? I try to care for her needs and am getting so drained...who’s there to take care of my needs?

TLDR: A husband’s cry for help from feeling hurt and drained by depressed wife’s actions"

I'm a male (so I don't have to deal with sexism). My family is very accepting and understanding. I don't have to worry where my next meal is coming from.

Yet my life feels just worthless and empty. I cannot form meaningful relationships (save for some old friends, and I feel we're becoming more distant every day). I'm pretty sure I will live and die alone.

And I don't really have a right to complain about anything. If people who have it much worse than me do have the will to live, how dare I do not?  I don't deserve to be in the place where I am.If only I could donate my life — everything I have — to a better person who's not been so lucky, I definitely would."

851,depression,I'm so alone,"I know it doesn't get better. Despite a variety of situations and circumstance, I still find myself here. Miserable. Homeless or nice home, dead beat or actively involved, addicted or clean, single or taken, educated or not, I am still here.

I close my eyes and daydream of nothingness. I know I won't be able to enjoy it. As long as I'm not feeling, not thinking then I'm OK.

My depression comes from multiple things. Debt. Unfufillfullness and worry about the future. Im an actor as a job. But I do everything I can to stay creative while my profession takes the back seat. But lately I cant so any of it. I tried to get better at drawing. Nothing. Signing. Nothing. Playing video games. Nothing. Writing. Nothing. It's been a extremely rough year for me.

858,depression,"Wrote this to a friend who is a girl and I think I have feelings for her, was half awake while writing it.","(For context I am diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, OCD and some type if anxiety disorder, was first diagnosed at age 11 with severe OCD and general anxiety and depression, 8 years later, had a major relapse of self harm that was coupled with an opiate addiction. My first suicide attempt was at age 8 and have attempted 7 more times after that until the age of 16 which was my last attempt. 8 coincidentally is not only the first age in which I attempted to take my own life and the amount of times I’ve attempted to do so  but also my OCD “completion” number. We have been friends for a year or more now and have had conversations not only about everything I am disclosing but as well as our feelings about each other, there is a connection but I haven’t really opened up this deeply about any of this with her.) 

Share your opinion or whatever you please, I don’t know why I am posting this here but I feel it may help someone else so I guess I figured “why not”?

Sorry we haven’t talked a lot recently I haven’t been feeling like my usual self some days I feel completely emotionless and others I’m yearning to feel something I haven’t before or at least haven’t in a long time, meanwhile just trying to help myself to fix my brain, I feel as though everything is bleak and my name is meaningless though I try to give it purpose and make it mean something if not to myself then at least one or two or even more people, It’s not attention I crave it’s the emotions of others, to see them in their rawest state of self, I often silence this craving with feelings of insignificance and feelings of worthlessness and label my self as a whole as undeserving of a deeper purpose. If there is anything I could say that gives me a feeling of hope that maybe someone will understand this and accept that I am trying so desperately to move past this and form a deeper connection with at the least one person in this world of random chances with an unlimited number of outcomes and possibilities, I would say it in the form of I love you, and with that word it would be the planting of a seed that would grow and take on a new meaning and definition every day, every week, every year, every decade, for what I want to believe would be eternity, though... it is not within my heart or mind to conceive of a spiritual life after this one upon our deaths, I believe that life is made more precious without the concept of life here after, our time here is finite and thusly must be respected, cherished and not squandered by life’s pity and sorrows. We should live our lives as free loving and carefully as possible as to preserve our own lives and the memories we leave once we’ve left."

860,depression,August is cancelled.,"This month has been one ole brain fog. Everything that could go wrong has. I've been retreating inward and today decided to cancel all my plans and stay in bed. Nothing like an extrovert cancelling the things that keep them happy to realize you are brushing the bottom of the trash can that is life. 

Between my mom yelling at me about protestors being criminals and how Trump is a good person and then me breaking my foot and then the one nice thing I decided to splurge on this year getting stolen in the mail, I just feel so empty. I bought a hiking pack I was so excited for, broke my foot, and then my package was stolen. I blame myself for not checking the mail room Tuesday night because walking is hard. I have barely seen my friends since they live a half hour drive away and you know, pandemic. I feel really empty and sad and upset. The worst part is like my life is so much better than it was and so much better than other people's it's like why am I complaining about a small foot fracture and a purchase that eventually I can save up for again? Sometimes my brain just wants me to hurt myself and the fact it has been weeks of depression, I want to let it win. Just like I haven't hurt myself in almost a year and August is so fucking bad I'm thinking about it nearly daily. Shit sucks. My friends think I need therapy but my therapist literally told me I didn't need therapy anymore and dropped me as a client. This is a ramble. I hope people's Augusts have been better than mine. As far as I'm concerned though, this month is cancelled."
861,depression,I don't want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive,"I think this is something most of the people who suffers depression can relate to.

862,depression,I think got rejected,"Hi all, english is not my native language, so i'll probably make some errors.

Well,days ago i downloaded tinder, u know, long term relationship ended and i was searching someone to talk to, and why not, maybe build a new relationship. First math is this girl, obviously ot of my league, but we start chatting, she talks to me about her passions, like history, and even if i hate it, i really appreciate every single fact she tels me about. I ask her out, she tells me it's too early, and then starts this game ""if you answer an history question i accept"". Then we chat more. For a day she disappear, she never talked much, only on night we could chat. well in the end i answered a question, an easy one, so i, instead of asking her out again, i asked her number. U know, never been this brave with girls, but she was always like ""be confident!"" or ""it's right that u dont give up on me"". Well, now the match disappeared, it happened already, but it was a bug of tinder, so now i contacted the support, maybe is just another bug. But u know, i have the big depression xd, so the first time the chat disappeared i entered a state where i preferred dying rather than being alive and have my head exploading. So yeah, now i think this is not a bug, i think she unmatched, and the thing is i dont think i'm taking it well ahaha. Life just sucks, every time something good happens, it just......vanish. And here i ame writing on reddit and crying because of a fucking beautiful, smart, interesting girl, who just gave me hope, and than maybe found some guy more interested in history or maybe better looking. I'm not saying this is wrong, but u know, at least let me know that u aren't interested anymore. That hurts more than a reject....Dont even know why i am writing this, it's just all pointless...

dont know if this is the right subreddit for this, but hey, im in the club of depressed kids xd(not so happy about it)

Sorry for bothering you with my fucking stupid problem.

But thank you anyway...."
863,depression,Is it wrong that I’m angry and upset?,"I posted this on a different subreddit but I also wanted your opinions

Ok so here’s the story. My friend and I had plans to hang out tonight to try and help me curb some alcohol issues and distract me from my depression. Now this friend knows I’m not in a good headspace at all at the moment.

So I showed up to an event we both go to half an hour ago before we are meant to meet up in an hour and he said “I’ve planned something else so I’m going to have to cancel.”

Now I don’t know what to do. I’ve stepped away from soccer ready to ball my eyes out. Over the past few days I’ve been in a really dark place and looking forward to what we had planned tonight so is it wrong of me to be pissed at my friend?"

There’s this cute girl too and I feel like a dick cause we were supposed to hang as a group yesterday but I just think they all enjoy their company more than mine and I don’t wanna bother. Suicidal thoughts are back and y’all call me crazy but I’ve had dreams for so long now about slitting my wrist and I’ve already tried and it just makes me wanna do it more and more. I hate forming relationships bc I’ve always lost everyone and I mean everyone, people who I called family and family themselves lol. I wish I could explain how I feel but I can’t because it’s just a feeling of emptiness and lack of belonging. I really don’t wanna bring that vibe around these people because they’re all so nice but I’m just really nervous and once again, feel like I don’t belong. Worst part is I want to feel like I should. I know this is my fault for not getting over my past but I hate that I end up faking or barely talking it’s just shit sucks, sorry y’all"
865,depression,My mums depressed and I don't know how to handle that fact that my graduate certificate was damage without causing her more emotional harm!?!?,"Not sure if this is the right place but here anyway...

I've recently graduated and today I got my certificate through the post. It was damaged slightly because the post woman had shoved it through the letter box but nothing big, my mum wanted to take a picture of it and put it on the table where my sister had just bee eating messy Chinese food (I didn't realise this). My mum gave it back to me and she was so happy big smile which is rare because she has depression and woke up bad today. But then I looked at my certificate and it was ruined there was a stain on the back of it that was seeping through to the front, I managed to wipe of most of it but the main damage was already done. I just burst into tears and started making horrible sobbing sounds and my mum just sat there looking at me like I'd kicked her happiness into the grave which just made me cry more. I really upset my mum even though I didn't say it was her fault she told me I had made her feel like it was and she doesn't want to talk to me now because of my overreaction to situation as the stain and bent bits wont show once it's framed or I can just get another one. 

I have emailed my university and am hoping to get a new one printed and sent out, but I don't know if I will will have to pay for or how long I will have to wait and I'm not sure that the stain can be hidden by a frame.     

I'm really upset and but now I feel like I can't show it because it will just make my mum feel worse. What's worse is I told my family I was receiving it this week I don't know how I'm going to tell everyone who asks to see it no without crying again."

He sent the first check. I could tell instantly that it was fake.

Took it to the bank. They told me point blank that it was fraud.

Goodbye, dreams of moving out.

867,depression,I wish I couldn't feel emotions,I just wanna numb the pain numb my emotions and then maybe I could love a good life but no I fucking feel shit because I'm bipolar and depressed like fuck I'm going to fucking go insane I just wanna stop feeling I hope one day I protest is happening near by and I just fucking walk into it while they're shooting people up and I end up dying I really and honestly do wish I could fucking die I don't want to live if I have to feel these emotions
868,depression,I tried to kill myself,"Last Saturday I felt so bad I actually did it. Took pills etc. My roommate found me and called an ambulance.      
.     
At first when I got out of hospital it felt like weight lifted off my shoulders. Like I killed the depressed me and now I was left with a hollow emotionless shell, who at least didn't feel the sadness anymore.       
.    
However, today I returned to being sad, but worse. I don't want to bother anyone, they already worry so much. My best friend who I could always talk to dumped me two weeks ago because I was being too sad and he didn't know how to handle it. Now I'm just afraid the same will happen to all my other friends if I bother them with my issues. What should I do?"
869,depression,"I called the Suicide Lifeline again. I don't know how, but it helped.","Last night was really rough. Due to an enormous amount of various problems in a life that won't stop knocking me down, I felt like my time had come. I had gone from ""wanting to disappear"" to ""what can I use to kill myself tonight?"" I couldn't stop crying, I had had enough, but I couldn't think of anything, so I did what I've done a few times before: called the lifeline. Even though most of the conversation was me bitching and ranting, it helped to have someone listen, even if it was a complete stranger. I highly recommend calling if you are feeling like shit. They may not be able to directly help, but having someone who listens to your complaining, and who doesn't judge you, can literally be a life saver."
870,depression,Depression has gotten worse but meds are not working. Any suggestions on what else I can try?,"Family history if bi-polar and medication-resistant depression. Currently, my sister is going through the same thing and my mom also went through this when we were kids. I do not know where to turn. Seems like every time the Dr. will try something new they are so confident it will work then I feel bad telling them I feel the same or even worse."
871,depression,I have no purpose to live.,More people have said try wanted me dead than people saying they wanted me alive. More people in this world hate me than people that like me. I am useless and annoying. The world would be just a better place if I wasn’t in it.
872,depression,I’m 20 but in my head I feel like I’m 16,"I’m 20 but I feel exactly the same as when I was 16. It’s so frustrating and pathetic. There’s so many things I’ve missed out from what other teenagers would experience and I’m just never going experience those things in the same way. Like having a crush in school/sixth form/college. Waiting for their classes to finish so you can see them, spending time together in between lessons, studying with each other, catching the bus together then doing it again the next day"
873,depression,Never feeling like I’m wanted,"I’ve never really had healthy friendships as a child a lot of kids would only hangout with me if they got something in return. It wasn’t until I started talking to people online that I found a place I felt like I belonged, however I have my moments that nobody really cherishes me, that i’m not anyone’s best friend. I have some friends online mostly, but can’t help to feel incredibly lonely when I see them doing stuff together and always talking about each other every hour of the day. Doesn’t help that my laptop died and I live with my nosy family that I can’t do calls or watch movies with them.

I did however start writing to people (penpals),seeing letters in my mailbox really makes me feel important and happy however the feeling it doesn’t last long and I’m stuck feeling forgotten until the next letter arrives. I just wanna be someone’s favorite you know? I hate it"
874,depression,I can't see the light,"   Its dark here, in this mind of mine. Dark and hopeless without a means to an end. I don't feel excited or happy or look forward to anything anymore.

 Current events in the country don't help at all. I can't help but think the end of the world is really here. Nothing changes and people fear it. People point fingers and blame but have no idea how to see their own faults and shortcomings. Compassion and empathy are just GONE. 

 I think too much. Way too much. I wish it would stop, shut off go radio silent. But it won't and I want to come undone. I wanna scream at people who lack common sense. Even if I did scream no one would hear me. No one is listening. No one ever does. I'm too soft spoken but when I speak up I'm loud and bitchy.

  I complain a lot. Nothing is up to parr and I cannot stand things done half assed so I end up stuck having to do it all myself. I'm tired. Exhausted really. Daily life of keeping up with the Kardashians and I even have the ass for it. 

   I don't compare. Not to the beauties of this world or the wealthy. I am no one. No one you can see anyways. No one you can hear. No one....just no one."
875,depression,I tried again this weekend,"This is literally my first post on reddit ever, I don't even know if it should be in here or r/SuicideWatch honestly.

Lately my living situation has been terrible, my house is disgusting and i haven't the will, the drive or the energy to clean it and I have bed bugs which is SOOO amazing in itself. Money has not been great, and I already live paycheck to paycheck. The only friends i do have never want to hang out or let alone come over (who can blame them?) Stress from work has been reaching an all time high, so to say the least I have been a bit stressed.

It all happened super fast, like in a blur.

Sunday a friend and I played some games online and talked about the stuff that was bothering me and i was feeling a lot better. That even lasted through out the day. That evening I went to take a shower and get ready for work in the morning, next thing I knew I was in the tub, I had written a note, drank an entire bottle of Jack and was cutting! I texted my friend to get my dogs and I left their food open so they could eat until someone realized i wasn't alright. I have no idea why I got out and called 911, but the cops came and took me to the ER, where I was then admitted.

I spent 4-5 days in the hospital, my mom picked me up and my friend brought my dogs, and now I'm alone, and I don't like it here. I feel like a ghost in my own home I feel like i don't belong here anymore. I also feel like everyone I know hates me for what I did. idk what to do and idk why I'm even posting this or if I even will! I just wanted to tell someone, anyone i guess. I regret what i did: to myself, my friends, my mom, and my dogs. I dont think it was depression that caused it, i havent been depressed in a while, i think it was stress, but the thing that sucks is I'm more depressed now than I EVER was before this.

thanks for taking the time to read this if you did, i just wanted to get it out....

876,depression,"Really dont know, maybe i am losing it","Hi there,

just wanted to vent a bit because there seems nobody who cares.

So i was taking cymbalta for like 9 years. In the.beginning i felt great on it. I got it subscribed because of social phobia and depressions, i thought it would.maybe better to just quit. 

Now i started to think like that some weeks ago with a lot of anxiety. Thinking people dont like me, think and talk bad about me, thay i am nuts and dangerous. I started to think again about quitting, but i do have a girlfriend and 2 dogs which i do love and care about. 

Fast forward, So i went to the doc, he subscribed me celexa. today is my 7th day of 10mg. Tomorrow.i will go on 20mg. The thing is, i did have a.mood change 3 days ago, felt like my world was ending in the morning, even after taking the pill. During the day i just felt a bit ok, but didnt want to talk to anybody and just wanted to stay in my bubble. Like Yesterday was feeling good, but i have the impressions people at work talk about me and think i am nuts or whatever. This because i mentioned i am.on antidepressant, and i am a person who looks at people ant trys to read their reactions. I am like that since i was young.

I am scared to let people in my life, i have a need to talk about how i feel but then again i feel that when i talk too much i scare them away. I think and feel that everybody just thinks and stays in their own bubble, where everything is ok. But as soon as something comes on their path they arent familiar with they panick or whatever. 

Sorry for this very long story, i have so.much on my mind and its very very hard to put it in words on paper.

Anyways, didnt sleep that good.last night because when i wake up i feel like crap and just think about this crap and thinking about if it is really worth to go on like this. I feel like people just avoid me, i always take my pill in the morning around 9 o clock so maybe i will feel better and think a bit normal.again after taking that pill, i hope so but even when taking the pill i feel like you are on your own with your thougts with nobody who understands or really cares, i really think that. 

Ok enough for now because i am not sure if anybody can understand what i just wrote.

Have a nice day anyways"
877,depression,"Been taking paroxetine for 3 days, hands shaking like I'm an alcoholic in withdrawal","Is it normal ? I'm 21 and it's my first time taking antidepressants, combined with Buspirone

878,depression,Am I actually depressed or am I attention seeking?,"I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me. I have been having a shit life for a year now ever since I started isolating myself in school and lost a friend because he moved away (and I cut him off later because he was toxic). For last year I've been isolating myself more and more. I had suicidal thoughts back in December but they stopped around February when I got invited to a birthday party and started lifting again. 

However I always am feeling out of place, I don't belong here. I'm always thinking about how lonely I am. It's also worse when I have a abusive dad. He makes everything worse. He hates me and is physically and emotionally abusive.  

I would always keep overthinking. I know it's not good but I can't change it. I would avoid going out in public because I could fuck up and make it awkward. 

During the summer, I coped with loneliness by playing videogames and working out. However since school start I can't. It's always on my mind.
For past 1.5 month, since I started to know school Is soon, I've had extreme bad sleep. I sleep barely. I get in bed but eathier regret things or cry or get angry at myself l. No matter what, it's hard to sleep. I told my mom I can't sleep (I didn't tell her about the fact I cry, she would probably not take it seriously) and she said it's because I'm using the phone. Even tho I told her I'm using it with orange light .

Since I can't cope with my thoughts, they get worse.
I'm  always feeling everything is pointless, I'm always thinking bout how lonely I am. I feel like I'm not working out hard enough and I barely do it.

When in playing games im always thinking about how lonely I am and how much of a loser I am. I'm always thinking how everyone in school have so many friends and I'm nothing. I've been not enjoying videogames at all. When I play them I'm thinking how this is just a escape and feel kind Dirty. I feel like I'm taking a drug. 

I can barely get myself to study and workout. When I'm exercising, rather than focusing on the exercise and targeted muscle I'm focusing on how lonely I am. It's always in back of my head . 

When I'm in school, I can't focus. I just think about how this is pointless and I'm still never gonna get A or how I'm so lonely. 

I can't sleep and focus at all. I'm always out of energy. I drink coffee to try to get energy but it's not helping. 

Even when eating and watching YouTube I can't focus on what the YouTuber is saying. I'm just thinking how this is a escape. 

I try to workout but I see it as a choir instead of a hobby. im always thinking how I always will be skinny and I'm weak. Every guy in my class is more muscular than me. I'm weak and skinny. I'm getting stronger but I'm still weakest in my class. I feel its pointless even tho I know I must do it.

The only thing I find fun is cooking, however I can't do it that much Because my parents think healthy ingredients are expensive (my dad says so while he buys fast food every day).

I'm starting to think again if life isn't even worth it. If all I do is lock myself in toilet in school break and try to focus in a lesson but can't then is this really worth it ? I'm probably gonna grow up to be a lonely loser without a friend or SO my whole life. 

I dislike self diagnoses but most symptoms i Read apply to me. Im not the most self aware person but I like to think I kinda know myself . I try to be optimistic but i can't. I'm always holding back tears In school wishing if someone wanted to be friends with me. 

Is this actual depression or am I overthinkig it like I do with most things ? Idk what to believe now days.... Depression is a strong word but I Wanna know if I'm depressed or not ...


Edit : thanks for kind comments. I love how people on the internet are nice."
879,depression,Is it normal to think about wanting to die everyday?,"Is it normal to think about wanting to die everyday? Like i dont think about how i actually want to do it or thinking about actually doing it but more of like the idea of me not existing anymore. Like i would lovee to not be alive but i dont want to kill myself. I guess i just feel like there isn't anything worth living for. Like why should i continue living with my parents who constantly pressure me 24/7, feeling miserable and tired all the time, and always feeling left out of everything my friends do?"
880,depression,Its 2am and I am crying my eyes out since midnight,"I cannot stop crying, and all i am doing is listening to all the depressing/sad music I have on apple music, not thinking much besides “I will never be loved as I truly wish i could be”; “he will leave me one day” ;”everyone is better than me”; “i don’t really think i will ever be happy with the person i am inside and out”.
The reality is that I have felt this way since I was a little kid, at school I felt like I was always left out, at home i didn’t feel protected or loved ,and now as a grown adult I learned to cope with most things and pretend to be a very stable person, when all I do is spiral over how worthless I feel."
881,depression,A very slow suicide,"I'm killing myself slowly. I recently lost pretty much everything and had to move back in with my parent. I'm 20 and that kills me to admit. But while I've been saving money on rent, ive been blowing it and drugs, alcohol, and cigars. I'm partying almost every night with some one after work. Or occasionally with myself which is almost worse. These things make me feel so happy for a while, but the real reason I do it is much darker. I know these things kill people, and I like that. I keep pushing my limits with harder drugs, more booze, and more cigars because I'm counting on that small fact. I want it to kill me. I want my heart to just give out. I want my brain to finally stop working. I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, so I'm having the drugs do it for me. An early grave sounds like a pretty good deal for me and I'm having fun in the process. It's a win-win"

I don't know what's wrong with me. Whether Im on the spectrum, bipolar, anxious, have ADHD, I genuinely don't know, I just know something is wrong with me. I haven't had trouble making friends, but I have trouble feeling close to them. Or building a strong connection. And even with my closest friends I have an underlying fear of driving them away. I have trouble interacting with people, I miss social quos at times, am awkward generally, have a very intense personality. I have an underlying need to be apart of the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate myself. I hate that Im overweight, I hate that Im socially awkward. I can't help but feel so much self hatred, something I know is toxic yet I can't fucking stop. I've wanted to die for years but have been too scared to go through with it, so I make excuses for why I shouldn't.

The biggest thing I was looking forward to this year was taken away from me. It was the last bit of hope I had, the reason I kept on pushing and stayed optimistic that life has something to offer me. Life is spitting in my face and telling me there’s nothing to keep on going for. I wish I had the guts to just end it."
885,depression,I could use some strategies on how to ask family for help? I've never done it before.,"Just so you guys know, it's not that I'm new with depression, it's just that I've been handling it myself for the past 4 or 5 years. These years have not been entirely successful, and my health has taken a rather steep decline as of late. I've only ever been to therapy once before (life threatening behavior, to put it lightly), and it was not an enjoyable experience. Since then, I have been resistant to the idea of finding a therapist. 

So now that the introductory part is done, I could use some battle strategies that have worked in the past and some tips. I personally have issues with admitting to others that I'm in need of this kind of help, especially to my parents. I'm on my dad's insurance and I need to know if our plan covers therapy. Then after that, i need to obviously work with him to get a session set up with my SO's therapist. From there hopefully the professional can help me, but I really need someone else's ideas on how to approach this. All I've been getting told to do by my friends is to just straight up ask. I'm aware that this may be the best or only plan, but if there is a way that I could do that more comfortably, I'd greatly appreciate any input that you may have. 

I apologize for the wordiness of this post, I have an issue with establishing credability with stuff, since i don't talk about it much. I'm rambling again, I'm sorry."

887,depression,Looking for some help on turning my life over.," 

Hey Redditors,   
I’m a 12 year old boy turning 13 in 2 months. I created this account because I’ve seen my favourite YouTubers on it and seen that it’s not just for gaming. I’m fat and lazy according to my friends and family. My parents are divorced and I live with my abusive mother and go to my fathers house every weekend. My father currently lives with his nephew, his parents and his fiancé. Everyone I open up to refers to me as depressed. I experience suicidal thoughts and feel “emptiness” every time i get yelled at or put down. I’ve gave up on all my dreams of being successful and having a nice family. My friends and family told me to focus on losing weight. My stepmother calls me a “fatass” and refers to me as a “fatty”. I’m not sure if she’s joking as I never heard she say she is. About 2 weeks ago I was at my fathers house and nobody was home. My cousin was at the beach with my father and my stepmother. My grandparents were at work. I tried hanging myself with the air conditioning cord as it is thick and long. While I had the cord around my neck my best friend called me. She asked me if I was down to play some games. As the fat and lazy kid who locks himself in his room to play video games everyday, I couldn’t resist as it was the only thing that cheers me up. On August the 1st I was at my mothers house and there are 3 floors. The neighbours downstairs and we own 2 floors. My room is on the top where there is a window to climb on the roof. That day i tried climbing out the window and onto the roof to jump. But when I tried opening the window it didn’t open all the way. It was possible to fit through but I just couldn’t. I was too fat. The rest of that day I locked myself in my room and cried myself to sleep. The though of my leaving my family didn’t leave my head. I don’t want my mom to live with the fact that she lost her only child. I’m still on the verge of ending it all but I don’t have the courage to. I’m one of those weak people who couldn’t take it and tried ending it all. I’ve written 2 notes that lead to the notes on my phone which are when I was going through my tough times. 1 note was to all the people that put me down and helped me in life. But I just don’t have the courage to do it. I have all the reasons to but I just can’t. Before schools shut down, I used to get bullied for being fat and Asian. For “eating dog”, starting COVID-19 and for being a “chink”. I just laugh because i can’t stand up for myself. I tried that and ended up being in the office for “causing a scene”. My friends don’t know what i’m going through. Every time I try opening up they repeat the same phrase “stop crying”. Whenever it gets serious they say it’s a joke and i can’t take jokes. It’s all fun and jokes until i end my life one day. I’m not even sure if I can refer to them as friends. I make mistakes and don’t learn from them. I repeat the same stupid action every time.  Just looking for help here because i’m stuck in a deep hole and can’t get out."

They never took it seriously there’s this time where I took a bottle of pills and passed out for hours and I woke up they never even noticed one bit. To be honest in my head I was like damn I woke up. I tried to kill myself again a couple of months ago then that’s when they finally are like ok let’s get her help. They get mad because they say I need to open up more and I don’t know how. Every time I did talk about my problems they ignored it. I love my parents but they’re so toxic sometimes. I’m grateful for them and I’ll do anything because that’s just me I would drop everything to help my parents and siblings.Especially in the Hispanic culture I’m the oldest and it’s just a lot of pressure because you have to reach this expectations and I can’t seem to catch up.

892,depression,"I feel destined to fail. I am stupid, have no skills, cannot contribute to the society.","I am at a point in my life when don't even have motivation to type. But I was a really hard worker and worked extremely hard to get into university and come out with decent grades. But the academic achievement was purely due to hard work and doesn't help in real life. I am actually pretty stupid. 

I have quit or been fired from every job. The environment and people have been relatively kind to me, and I always end up disappointing them. Everything I try ends up failing, and as a result I now have zero motivation. 

I recently found out I have some cognitive impairment that can be temporarily repaired through balancing the neurotransmitters via antidepressants and other supplements. This makes me even more mad; I found a solution now. After all those years. Now. When I am at the bottom of everything. 

I don't know what to do...

I can't kill myself because of my family, who I love very much. 

I tried meditating so I go through an ego death and mentally kill myself? This sounds absurd. But seems like an ideal situation -- be physically present, mentally in another state. But even that has gotten me nowhere. 

I have done excercise before, specially running. It doesn't help.

893,depression,"Thanks to my porn addicion i exposed myself to 16-17 old teens on omegle and men(im straight) last year, wasnt thinking crearly,had a lapse judgement, feel guilty,wasnt my intention i was ignorant."," 

Hello,im close to 30 years old,i used to be exbicionist,i have depression,some autism(aspergers) i think and other mental issues, and last year i was using omegle looking for adult women to expose myself to,i always watched porn before to help me get excited.

i always ask their age and skip young teenagers(most have 15 or less), but in 4 situations for the first time the girls were aged 16-17 (3 had 17, 1 had 16),in the first seconds i was exposing and didnt asked their ages yet but i was too horny and focused and confused, had lapse of judgement and overlooked their age after reading it and continue to show myself for some seconds to a minute until they skiped. in my mind i thought to use age of consent to justify the exposure and i was deciding to skip or not but i took too long,

I even told one girl (17)she was undergaged to this and she laughed at me and she said she had sex before and showed her tongue for me to ejaculate, i ignored and she skiped.

, After some time i searched on internet that society disaprove this in genera( sex with teen 16-17), i was ignorant and stupid. I realized i was wrong months latter and feel guilty and i feel should be killed or something i have depression and i hate myself. By the way,It was consensual i didnt see they naked and they wanted to see me.

however it is still wrong to girls in that age look for naked men online, omegle is for adults. God i dont even attracted for this age group and im not some kind of p3do. I feel so gulty and need some closure, i think i need a therapist. everytime i read something about p3dophilia on the news it reminds me of those events. im also not gay and exposed to some men because i was too excited,but this is not serious to me.

Is it realy bad what happened about the girls? I feel so ashamed and disguted with myself, i even quit to exhibit and never had relationship before. I have suffered from depression since i was younger and im impulsive. can someone please give me an opinions about this? Please i fell awful and sometimes i cry. Tell me im just immature and this is common but in a different context.The guilty is killing me."

Get to college, graduate, get a good job, get married, have a baby. Check. Check. Check. I don't enjoy anything. I never have. Everything I do is work. Nothing is fun. I don't have hobbies. I have little things to fill the free seconds in my day, but I realize I'm not enjoying them. Every person I have tried explaining this to says to do things I enjoy. To look back on what made me happy like this has been a temporary ""depression"". It hasn't. This has been my life and I'm sick of it. I know things won't change if I don't change. But I don't know how. If the day was all mine to do whatever I wanted I would sleep until I couldn't anymore, then watch some crappy tv, then feel like I wasted my time. I've tried new things. They are all work. I've tried old things, they were work before and they're work now. Am I just destined to be a miserable person or is there a cure? Antidepressants, on them. Spent half my adult years working out and sleeping right and eating healthy. Hated every second of it. I've done the outdoors stuff. Played video games. I hated yoga when I was in class, but always felt pretty good for a little while after. That was probably the longest ""hobby"" I held before realizing I was walking in dreading it every time and there were days I couldn't push through that dread and go in. I'm sick of being miserable. My name says it all. Daily grind."
898,depression,I feel seriously depressed when school comes around,"I'm going into my third and final year of university and I've realized that school has brought about my depression. The semester is near and during the semester, I feel depressed. I have no motivation to do the things I love. I don't want to watch shows or play games or read or do anything I'd usually love to do. For the entire vacation I seemed to be fine. I think I was actually doing pretty well considering the entire covid situation. However, it's nearly a week before the semester starts and I can't find the motivation to do anything. 

Last year there was one week in university where I kid you not, I stayed awake for nearly 6 days. (I'm doing a double major in Computer Science and Physics, which in my opinion from everyone I've talked to, is arguably the most difficult thing to do at my university) I tried taking 15 minute naps here and there but other than that, I stayed up doing non-stop work. Assignments, labs and exams to study for. Everytime I finished 1, I got another one to do. I did nothing else besides school work for those 6 days and I hadn't even finished everything I was supposed to. I had to hand in some incomplete work. After that week I was broken. I fell into the deepest depression I've ever had. I tried to talk to my mom about it, but she didn't understand. So I went to a counselor at my university, but honestly, they weren't very helpful either.

After a very long time, I started feeling better, mainly because of my girlfriend; but it's long distance which is a whole other stress. After finishing year 2 I started to feel happier and actually motivated to do some things again. It was nice, it lasted about a month and a half before returning to the state I'm currently in. That week honestly broke me and I don't think I'll ever be the same again. I don't know what to do. My mom doesn't want me on any antidepressants and I feel like during the semester I won't even have the time to go see a psychiatrist or therapist or anyting.

This next year is going to be a crazy battle with depression if this keeps up. I don't know if I can live like that. I don't want to kill myself, but I really do feel like it'd be easier if I was dead given well I wouldn't have to care about any of it.

I was one of those extremely persistent people beforehand to the point where I would motivate myself just by the want of accomplishing something. To have that stripped from me to the point where I don't really care anymore is hard to deal with. I rather fail everything than have to go through something like that again. I wouldn't wish those 6 days of no sleep upon my worst enemy.

TL;DR: University had me working for 6 days with no sleep and now I'm broken and depressed whenever school comes around."
899,depression,Advice studying when you have bad memories.," I don't know if this belongs here but I have had problems studying, because of past memories. I used to do quite well in school, and my parents always pushed me to do more, attend olympiads and competitions. They didn't allow me to play or do anything else I liked, saying I should rather study than waste my time playing. Growing up, this has led to me being averse to studying or doing work of any kind. I am a slacker in college, and I never study because of this. I don't know how to beat this.

Similarly, a related incident was that I used to be kind of an over-enthusiastic student in middle school. I always used to have an answer to every question and an opinion to every argument. I wasn't arrogant, I just didn't know this could piss off other classmates or teachers if I did it all the time. Nobody really told me. One day, as usual I put up my hand to answer a question in math and the teacher yelled at me for always answering, in front of the whole class. I was really upset and I never answered to any question in class ever again, up to this day I have trouble interacting with teachers or authority.

The bad part is that come high school teachers only value and respect the ones who do answer in class. Atleast, in my school they did. So from that day on, as I always used to be silent, and interacting was my way of learning, I lost all interest in my subjects. Coupled with the aversion to studying because of my parents encouraging me to study all the time, I have no motivation to do anything. Even my assignments until the last minute when I have to. I can recognise this vicious negative circle but I can't stop it.

Does anyone have any advice?"
900,depression,I’m tired and lost,"Sophomore high school year started and I’m 5 days in, and I’m just tired. I get all the sleep I need but I’m just always tired. I’m already missing classes and being late because I just don’t have the mindset to do anything right now. I take a lot of sleeping medications to help me sleep but nothing seems to work and I’ve been dealing with depression for a while now and it’s gotten so much worse ever since this pandemic started. I feel like I’ve lost social skills and a lot of my confidence in everything, now it’s coming to the point of where I’m thinking to harm myself but too scared because of what my family would think. It’s just really hard because my mom always thinks I’m tired due to the fact that I’m playing games at a not so late time and it really isn’t, I do it to clear my head and it’s where I find my peace talking to my cousin on there which just makes me happy and some of my friends which are the only people I want to talk to including my brother. Then as I’m going to bed I cry I just ball my eyes out thinking about suicide and I really hate it but I just don’t know what to do at this point... everything feels so difficult and I want it all to end"
901,depression,"I hate how ppl who actually want to live, die, but I don't","People with aspirations, who would actually achieve something in life, or people just want to live, they die, but me, I don't want to be alive at yet I'm one of  the ""lucky"" ones that get to live.

 I could have died at birth, but no, I was ""saved"" while tons of people who could have probably achieved so much in their lives, or even if they didn't achieve anything, they would still be happy, they die.

Like why? I hate living, I don't want to live anymore why not take me out instead of the people that actually want to live?"
902,depression,Can school just start already,Being at home doing nothing is making my depression/anxiety much worse. I need something to keep myself occupied other than being on the internet and hulu.
903,depression,My mom doesn’t understand why I have depression,"Her reasoning is I have two loving parents who aren’t divorced, I have a roof over my head, I have food to eat, I have friends, and I have a good life. She then added on that when she was younger, she was poor and her father had just left her mom, basically speaking in a way worse situation than I am. She didn’t have time to be depressed because she would be too busy trying to earn money to pay school fees. 

My mom then proceeded to blame it on my sleeping habits and video games. I didn’t want to blow up at her, because I know she’s had depression before but was not diagnosed for it. I just find it hypocritical of her. I’m too exhausted to retort back. It really hurt when she said no one would believe me if I had depression if I kept acting lazy. 

I wish mental illness was more commonly talked about in ethnic households. I’m just really exhausted of trying to talk lately. I just want to be silent in my household. I can’t tell my dad either because he doesn’t have the emotional skills to deal with it at all. He can deal with physical problems but not emotionally."
904,depression,Health of body and mind,"I am mostly sitting in my dark room and do nothing.. watch stuff, listen to music and stuff but most of the time I am just in bed. And I have a stupid cough and a fever actually for about.. 1.5 years or something and other stuff that doesn’t go away anymore. I am getting pretty much no sunlight and energy and that stuff, And body is getting more fucked up and more sick.. and Idk what to do, Ik I am doing this myself but it’s so hard man, going outside and doing things, I really need some advice or imma lose it. If anyone experienced or experiences stuff like that or knows what would be a good next step.. pls let me know"
905,depression,Today was a bad day,I’m having an awful day. One of those days where everything happens at once and you are too depressed to handle it. I get overwhelmed very easily lately and tasks that seem “easy” and “normal” to some people are exactly the opposite for me. I ended up handling most of it just to end up in a sobbing puddle at the end of it all because it took everything out of me just to get through it. And I have nobody to talk to about it that understands at all. I feel like I’m drowning.
906,depression,Having a difficult time living by myself,"I live away from my family and boyfriend— the only close people I have. The reason I live far from them is for school. I wish I could simply make friends, but all of my social interactions with classmates are over zoom. I feel so deprived of true genuine human connection. I really feel awful inside every single day. I don’t know what to do anymore. All I know is that I can’t stand to keep living my days this way because it’s so painful. Before the pandemic, I was pretty okay with living my life in solitude because I had some face to face interactions coupled with my alone time which  I really did value, but this is a whole new level of loneliness."
907,depression,"365 days ago I almost killed myself, last night I almost did it again","Sorry for the long post. I’ve never wrote everything down so it might be sloppy. Also I’m on mobile

Growing up I (20m) was a little spoiled shit head to put it nicely. I have two older sisters (32 and 34) which made it feel like I was an only child growing up. I come from a well off family where financial struggles didn’t seem like an issue so growing up I would throw fits if I didn’t get what I wanted. One major incident that comes to mind is one Xmas when I wanted a BMX bike. My parents delivered on it and got me one but I threw a fit abt it because it wasn’t the model or color I wanted (idk I forget the specifics at this point). 
This lead to constant battles between me and my parents and I vividly remember spending my 11th birthday touring a military school because that was always the looming threat I got from my parents. But as shitty as I was at home, I still had good relationships with other adults and had good friends, I just needed to work out the kinks with my parents. Then after I “graduated” the 6th grade a lot changed.
6th grade was honestly where I feel like I was last content. I was the big man on campus getting ready to go to middle school with my friends who went to other elementary schools in the area. I remember being abt 2 weeks into summer vacation when my parents sat me down and told me we were going to be moving internationally. (I feel like it’s important to note that at this point my dad was going back and forth between country A and B for a couple weeks almost every other month) I was livid with them. It felt like I was betrayed and about to be thrown to the wolves just to make their lives more convenient. No matter how much they justified it I just never listened and never bothered trying to understand it. I spent the rest of that summer spending the little time I had left with my friends and constantly butting heads with my parents. They’d make appointments for me to do tutoring and learn the new language but I’d just blow it off. 

Then at the end of august we did it and we moved.
I had about a week there before I was going to start attending school. It was humid and hot as hell anytime I went outside so I poured myself into video games and essentially becoming a hermit (back in country A I loved going to the beach and surfing but everything was much further and harder to get to here). Then school came around and that was a whirlwind and a half. I could spend hours talking abt the different things I experienced that first year (good and bad) but it’s not that important. The only important things to note abt this first year was that it was all taught in this new language (except 1 class) so I had to translate everything to English and then do homework. It was the first time I actually felt like I couldn’t do school. I was bullied for being the only blonde kid in a largely latino school. I had a few friends at school but would rarely see classmates outside of class. 
That first year was brutal to me with where I was at in life and it didn’t feel like I had my parents support. I’d hear the typical “oh I know it’s tough now but it’ll get better” every morning as some days I’d have tears streaming down my face because I didn’t wanna go anymore. That first year was the first time in all my life that I had suicidal thoughts. 

Why go on if this is what it’s gonna be like for the next 6 years? I felt ignored and this was also around the time that my grandpa was caught stealing a fuck load of money from the company and my dad had to deal with that which meant all the “father/son bonding” was forgotten. 

The second half of that first year is a blur. I went numb most days. Go to class, get shitty grades that only really counted as passing because they knew I just didn’t understand any of it. I lost all my work ethic and the only thing I ever wanted to do was play video games and move back home.

Second year there got a lot better. I switched to a school that had more classes in English which meant the language barrier was slowly coming down. I had a couple friends there but again I rarely saw them outside of class and still stuck to being a hermit. Looking back I probably boarded up in my room to spite my parents who wanted me to “see this country for all the beauty it is”. While school was getting better I still wasn’t. The fights with my parents dialed back but I think that year was when they realized I just wasn’t gonna be able to make it there. So we had a long talk and we decided to move back but still keep our place there so my dad could go back and forth. 
So two years later I was back home and felt like all my problems would be solved then and there, I was very very wrong about that. The friends I had from before had changed and I fell outta contact with them. But I never let my parents see this because I thought they’d just move back if I was gonna be unhappy here. I ended up making friends that summer and have slowly branched out from there. 

High school was good and bad. I slowly made friends and found a friend group that I still have today. I met my best friend (Danny) my 2nd year and we’ve been friends ever since. That year I also ended up meeting a girl that made things complicated. It was my friends sister. I know it was a bad call and I regret it because of how it turned out but he said he was ok with it because I had good intentions and it felt like there was something there worth giving a shot. Well it ended after 3 months and then we tried again and it ended after a month. It was my own fault. I was stupid and instead of talking things through they ended. 
The rest of high school was pretty standard. I had a falling out with Danny our senior year because I kissed his ex one shitty night. I won’t go into detail here but I was in a bad place, I didn’t intend on it happening, and we’ve talked about it. That was the first time in a long time that I truly had actions to back up that I was a shitty person. I became anxious and depressed again.

The weird thing though was that the suicidal thoughts I’d had in the past would still come up periodically and to varying degrees. I never felt like I would act on it in the moment but to put it bluntly I never really recovered and just never felt like life was gonna be worth it in the end you know? But I’m young so I can have fun without thinking abt that. 
I had no clue what I wanted to study or what I wanted to do after that year. I picked the school that I did because it was the “best” of the ones I got into and seemed like it would be a good fit on paper. So I declare my major and commit to attending this university in the fall hoping I’ll find some kind of meaning to my life. Nope not the case. 
I tried to put myself out there with different things but I never felt like I clicked with anyone at the school. I felt lonely as fuck and after that first semester I just gave up on trying to make it work there. I spent most weekends driving back home. My ex also reached out to me and we started talking again. She was back home but we would never see each other for more than an hour when I was back. I didn’t even like being at home that much, I just liked it better than sleeping in my dorm all weekend and playing video games to no end. I had a talk with my parents about not going back and just staying home to attend a CC. They didn’t agree and wanted me to at least try a year there. In their defense, they had no idea I was contemplating suicide more often than not. On my drives home I’d close my eyes and think about swerving into the ocean. I thought about jumping out my window, finding something to OD on, or even just disappearing. 

There was one weekend I was home early on and I got into a big fight with my parents about them not wanting to support me if I’m not even gonna try. I really really wanted to push them away right then and there because then I could kill myself and no one would be around to let down. 

Second semester got a lot better. I met a girl in one of my classes who I quickly became friends with. We hung out a lot for that second half of the year. She had a long distance boyfriend so there was nothing romantic. I was happy to have someone in my life who would get me out of bed. We would go to the farmers market downtown most Thursday nights, take little adventures on the weekends. I truly don’t know what I would’ve done without her in my life. 

Besides her I ended up befriending ppl from the local CC in the town. It was nice to not feel so disconnected from the world but I also knew I would never make it at this school. 

By this point my grades were in the shit. I was on academic probation but I honestly didn’t care. School didn’t seem important to me because I didn’t even want to live past 22. I’d lie to my parents and say things were fine. Then the school year ended and I decided to stay home and go to CC for the next year. 
It felt like that was gonna be the answer to my struggles. It’s also important to note that during my first year I visited my friend in a city that I spent a lot of time in since my sisters both lived there and I loved it. From then on I decided that’s where I wanted to end up eventually. So summer comes and goes as fast as it normally does and slowly my friends trickle away to their respective universities. 

First day of class went good and I made an appointment with an adviser for the next day to discuss what classes to take, when to take them, etc. I walk into the adviser’s office, talk to him about my struggles last year, my goals, what units I already completed, typical stuff. He basically gave me an unneeded and unwanted reality check. He basically confirmed everything I already felt. That it was too late to try and graduate on time and that my goals were unrealistic about moving so soon. I wasn’t so much hurt with what he said, it was mainly the how he said it. I was coming off one of the toughest years I’ve had, honest to god surprised to have even made it that far, and the adviser who’s supposed to be helpful and somewhat supportive basically calls me an idiot and gives me a flowchart for classes that I could’ve found online. 

Wanna know the first thing I did after that? I went and bought 12 feet of rope. 

I had lunch with a friend after that and acted like everything was normal but I was struggling. I ended up making an excuse abt homework or something and began to tie and write a note. 

I don’t remember what I wrote exactly but it was something along the lines of “I appreciate everything everyone has done for me but I just don’t have the will to do it anymore”. It was tough writing it, just thinking about the hole I was gonna leave in my friend’s and family’s hearts. 

I had everything ready to go, the note, the knot, the sadness, but not the readiness. I had my neck through the noose, one foot off the chair, but I just couldn’t shake the thought of my parents. How would they feel? I know they aren’t perfect but they’ve apologized countless times for their flaws. I ended up taking the noose up to their room and completely breaking down about everything. It was a tough night for all of us.
The next day they got me to a therapist for the first time since we moved. He recommended I see a psychiatrist to start medication. I was optimistic that things might come around now that I was open with people but I stopped going to therapy after a couple months because it just made me feel like shit. I’m never one to openly share what’s going on so when I share something it’s hard to be coherent and I end up getting emotional. I felt like I was spending an hour once a week to go dredge up everything that’s wrong with me and then go back out in the world feeling like shit. I was put on a SSRI but never felt like it did anything more than a placebo at most. 

Several weeks after my incident I had my sisters wedding. I was looking forward to getting away for awhile. I don’t remember what happened but something snapped in me on the day of the wedding and I felt like garbage. I don’t even know why I felt like shit but I just did. After their ceremony I locked myself in my room and didn’t attend the reception. Something I’ll always regret and always have to live with. The rest of the year was full of ups and downs. My grades were doing better and I was working so the self loathing cut down a bit. I ended up trying psychedelics (shrooms) for the first time. I’m not condoning drug use but that was the first time I felt happy in so long. My head didn’t feel like a clouded mess. I felt like I could actually turn my life around. 
So first semester of my second year of college ends and I feel like I might be doing something right again. 
Two weeks into winter break and I hear the fighting between my parents start. I’d come home from work to see the dog with his tail tucked between his legs in the living room because they were yelling in their room. I don’t think they know that I heard them but I did. Then one night I come home from work as my moms leaving with tears going down her face. I go up to talk to my dad and I’ll still never ever forget the night that I saw my dad sob for the first and only time. I won’t go into detail but he told me they were gonna split up and he was gonna move to country B. I was devastated. No matter how much he tried telling me it wasn’t because of me or what I did I still couldn’t help but feel partially responsible. I mean it can’t be easy on a marriage when your son wants to kill himself.
I spent the rest of that night feeling really shitty. Not suicidal, just shitty. But the real kicker of it all? The next day it was totally fine. They went to breakfast and talked it out and everything was peachy by the time I woke up. I was happy but also distraught. The seed of doubt was already planted in my head and I still question their happiness together.

I started off spring semester good, I wanted to start feeling good about myself again. Two months go by, I’m going to all my classes, turning in my assignments but then corona hits the US hard so school is switched to online. This is where my bad habits take over again. I didn’t attend any classes and basically gave up. Why I did I still have no clue but I ended up on academic probation at a CC, something I didn’t even know was possible. Meanwhile everyone around me thinks I’m doing good and nothing is out of the ordinary. 

School ends and summer comes around. My ex and I start talking again and she says she wants to try things again. I was skeptical because of how things ended the last time but we still gave it a shot. We hung out two times and then the texting becomes less and less frequent. We make plans to go on a date after not seeing each other for nearly a month and she cancels last minute. I ask her if there’s any other time she could hang out soon since we hadn’t seen each other in awhile. No response.

It’s August. I still haven’t signed up for classes that start in a few weeks because I feel like I’ll just quit on them like everything else. I lie to my parents and say I’m signed up because I can’t face them and tell them the truth. 

At this point I have everyone in my life convinced that even though I’m depressed, at least I’m on the right track. I’m a pathological liar. There’s no other way to put it in my eyes. I lie to the ones I love. I lie to myself. I lie to everyone. 

After about 6 weeks I ended up texting my ex to try and get some resolution. I also thought that at this point she had moved away because she said she was spending next semester with some family on the other side of the country. She told me that she overheard a conversation her brother had with their parents where he said he was bummed that we dated because it made things awkward. It really really hurt to hear that because it was true. Since high school I always wanted to give the relationship a legitimate chance so I could show what I was about, I never wanted to sneak around. 

Fast forward to last night when one of my friends sends a picture of her dating profile. I wasn’t upset at the fact that she had one, I was upset that she had been in town this whole time and I had no idea. This combined with the fact that it was the anniversary of my last incident I was sent into a shitty depressive state. My parents are currently out of town so I couldn’t go up and talk to them so I went for a drive. I didn’t have a destination in mind, I just wanted to escape in some way. I filled up my tank, got on one of my favorite roads and just drove north. I thought about that scene in Breaking Bad when Walter white closes his eyes and drifts over. I stopped to smoke a couple times to help ease my nerves. I ended up at one of the spots I constantly thought about driving off and into the ocean. I pulled over and just sat there for awhile. I thought about life and everyone that’s in mine. I thought about my parents coming back to an empty house. I thought about my friends not knowing what happened. I thought about Danny who told me to be safe and that he cared about me when I said I was going for a drive. 

I didn’t have any life changing revelation last night. I just felt the guilt and selfishness of suicide. I still don’t know what I’m doing in life and my support system won’t last forever."
908,depression,There’s just one thing keeping me from blowing my brains out...,"My infant son’s laughter. I want to cry every time I hear it. He’s just so happy *all* the time and I can’t help but wonder how something so beautiful and innocent is my son. Me. Someone’s whose very soul is just tainted in despair. 

I’ve been wanting to end it for so long now. I just want to drive out in the middle of nowhere and end it all. My life insurance policy would give my son a future I could never give him. That money would set him up for the rest of his life...

I work so hard for such a pitiful wage. Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful to have a job. I know too many people who’ve lost theirs. But, I make the bottom of the barrel for what I do. My co-workers make a significant amount higher and I’ve asked for only a small amount higher. But, the company is too busy spending money on lavish executive dinners and booze to care about me. But, whenever they need the legwork done, they call me. Whenever they need someone to risk their health and come into the office to do XYZ, it’s me. My co-workers are too lazy to want to do it, so it’s up to me. All the time.

My family doesn’t really give me much a care either. My brother is too wrapped up loving on his car that mom and dad bought him. My mother straight up hates me. Removed me from her will because I was tired of her trying to control every aspect of my life. Dad? Well... he’s never really there...

Nobody cares. Nobody cared when I was in the service, nobody cares now. That’s fine. I’ve lived that way for a while now. 

I’ve always come to the conclusion that maybe I should just remove myself from the equation altogether. Yeah. Maybe that’s the best route. 

But every time I get to the edge and make my mind up to jump...

I hear his laugh again. 

And I cry all over again."
909,depression,"I had to answer a ""tough"" call today","When I woke up the first thing I checked was my phone to see I was late for school, and as I was looking at my screen when I got a call from my dad, he was calling to tell me our dog was dying. He ask me if I wanted to see him one last time, and I said yes but a few minutes later my mom was yelling at him over the phone because he told me, she was mad at him because I was already in a fragile state and didn't need to hear that, she acted like it was his fault. He is just as sad as I am about it, so he told my grandma to pick me up but had to call Back because he had already died. The last time I saw him was a week ago, and I was looking forward to seeing him again, but now that will never happen. I miss him. He was a great dane and a rescue dog, and he died in pain, I didn't even get to see him. I feel so bad, we have had him for so long and I only have on picture. I miss him so much... I want to just go to sleep forever, that would be nice."

911,depression,burden,"first, i’m sorry for wasting your time. in no way is my position unique, special, or game changing. i am pretty much the scum of the earth and i’ve made everyone who’s loved me get sick of me.

i don’t know anything anymore. i don’t have goals, i don’t have a path, i have no aspirations, no passions, nothing. i am a loser to the core. everything i’ve given a shot has embarrassed me countlessly and i crash hard when i fail. 

i used to be transparent. letting people know what goes on in my life, with the belief it would help people. it only made them find me annoying, helpless, and someone that deserves to be alone so he can “figure it out” 

maybe i do deserve to be alone. forever. i have provided next to no joy in anyone’s life as of late. my parents are getting increasingly tired of my lack of energy and happiness and i just want to one day leave the house so they never have to deal with me again. i want to die so badly, but i hate the fact some people want me to stay. they would get over it. everyone would. that’s how life works. i am easily replaceable and i have provided no dent in the world or even my community. 

this post will probably be seen by maybe 2-4 people. and i wouldn’t blame any of you for downvoting this. i deserve hatred and everything bad in the world. i am nothing, and i will always be nothing, no matter what i do. no one will love me again. the days of joy are long gone. the future looks bleak. 

again, sorry for wasting your time. this only scratches the surface. i hate therapy because talking about things doesn’t make a difference to me and it leaves me feeling guilty for consuming the time of someone who probably doesn’t and shouldn’t care about my insignificant piece of shit self. 

i’m sorry."
912,depression,I attempted suicide yesterday.,"It didn't work obviously. Or maybe it did and this is purgatory. Who can say for sure.

I wish it worked. Because now I'm just alone in my room with my thoughts and my phone. I watched something and it made me forget about everything for an hour. As soon as it's over, there's that thought in my head saying ""I wish I was dead"". So, I keep distracting myself and when the distraction is over, ""I don't think I should be alive"".

There's two people in my life who know the extent of my depression. And I try to keep this pain from spilling over. I already lashed out at one of them. A fuck-up I can't repair.

I try to remind myself of the reasons to stay alive, no matter how small.
I want to stay alive so I can make tea in the morning. I want to stay alive for my little brother so he doesn't lose his one and only sister. I want to stay alive so I can see my dad again. I want to stay alive so I can enjoy base pleasures.

But what makes this life worth it if I feel like this every fucking day. Every day with the thoughts in my brain. Trying to function normally so nobody knows that I'm struggling. Trying to be normal so the ones who know my struggle don't have to worry about me.

I'm so fucking tired of this mask I put on every day. When will the day come when it is no longer a mask? Why can't I be happy and content.

I wish I could be a kid again. Just a child with her books, her sketchbook, and her cat. 

I'm so fucking tired and I can't sleep."
913,depression,"I dont know how to escape, but for now ill simply share.","A while back I did something I never thought would make such a large impact on my life. I learned to build. I figured out how to make things that would last. Constructs that could weather any storm I could foresee. I built an entire complex with high walls and numerous rooms. With just that being said someone would say that i'm quite the engineer or handyman. To my own disappointment that is not the case here. These buildings have all their rooms and the walls so high that you can't see over them even from the highest floor. These things don’t even exist. At least not in reality. This complex exists in my mind. Each room with a purpose. Each corridor a guide through the madness. In an odd way I felt like this was a good way to navigate through life. Everything was in order and nothing too chaotic was left unsorted. Regardless of the effective design Its flaws are hard to ignore now. I left no way out. I have trapped myself within my own construct. I'm not afraid to escape. But the walls are too high to climb. I can only smash these walls down piece by piece. At times I can see someone through the holes I had made. I ask for help as I reach out but it feels like they dont hear me, or I don't hear them. I've trapped myself within my own mind. My reality is warped and misshapen. 
I'm tired of looking at the same walls. I'm exhausted from walking down the same paths and corridors that take me to the same places. 
If it was as easy to just stop thinking so much and escape the prison I've created for myself I would have done so long ago. I have to demolish this complex. Burn it to the ground leaving nothing but a foundation. Only then will i be free from myself."
914,depression,life is a joke,wouldn't it be nice if life were easy? every single day for me is a  struggle. i have multiple issues and health problems and they will  probably only get worse from here. i think i was never meant to be born.  life is a joke and a game. and i cannot win. it feels like i cannot  win. i sit here in my room at my parents' apartment. rented. the car is  rented. the ones we owned were repossessed. the apartment is dirty. i've  lived in hotels with my family. family contributes to my downfall. i  contribute to my downfall. yet i can't escape. thanks for reading.
915,depression,why can't acceptance be enough?,"i've been very depressed the past six months for various reasons, pandemic and non pandemic related. like more depressed than i thought i could ever possibly be in my life because this is the hardest half a year i have ever had. and this is not the first time i've struggled with things before. i have pretty bad ptsd and my first time in a psych hospital was at age 11. what i'm trying to emphasize is it feels like things will never get better and i don't know if i will ever remember what joy feels like again.

i'm a freshman college student and my classes started on tuesday over zoom. in the days before the pandemic, optimism genuinely helped me. but now i really feel like i have no will or reason to live. just completely drained of any drive i once had. and this year started so great! i got into my dream school on a full scholarship! other things in my life were going generally well! and then it went all downhill and the moment school went virtual i became extremely depressed and i don't think i can get out

i straight up hate zoom. i have spent the past few days sitting at a desk for about 12 hours with a few breaks attending class and doing work. i have adopted a ""i hate this, it sucks, but this is the way things are right now"" approach to the current situation. a lot of things hurt, quite frankly. i haven't seen my friends. i lost my job bc it was not essential. my abusive mother kicked out shortly after my 18th birthday with zero notice (and despite the fact it has been in some ways a relief, it was also a terrible week). i am not going to have a normal first year of college. i will not lie about how much it hurts. it may seem small to you, and it probably is, but i am at the lowest point of my life right now and my one way of coping as i used to struggle to get out of bed was seeing people. showing up. etc. things we cannot do during the pandemic. anyways, i saw something that told me i needed to think ""on the bright side"" about this semester and most likely this entire year. and i broke down and burst into tears and have been crying on and off for hours because of it. i am SICK to death to being told i need to be overly cheery about an incredibly hard time. my college experience is literally sitting at a desk for hours, at home, on zoom with people i will probably never meet.  it's literally all of the hard stuff without any of the fun activities that make it bearable. can i just accept that? why isn't that enough?? i'm not going to pretend like i am enjoying a time that is making me extremely depressed. i am doing the best i can. why isn't that enough?"
916,depression,It all goes downhill....,"Once you start giving up!

Keep on pushing and stay strong! 💪🏼"
917,depression,Today was another failure,"Had plans in mind, but accomplished nothing. Feeling disappointed. I feel stuck. I hate life. I hate myself. I hate my very existence. I want to die. If i die then all my problems would be solved. No need to deal with any bs anymore."
918,depression,Tonight’s overwhelming thoughts; In about a month I’ll be moving to a new state. My parents will go with me to ease the transition but eventually... it’ll just be me. Send hugs pls.,"I’ve lived with my family in this house for 14 years. The furthest I’ve lived away from home was 30 minutes. I’m about to move 13 hours away. 

Gonna go from doing lockdown with my family to being alone six days a week once my parents leave. 

No money. No job. Doing it for school."
919,depression,How did you regain the ability to do the things you once loved?,"Hi,

I consider myself a film buff. Would watch an unhealthy amount of movies, make short films, write scripts--any free time I had, that's what I'd be doing. I loved it.

And then a breakup happened 3 years ago (I am over it), and it's been tougher to start creating again with each passing year. Which sucks, because I've always been creative. Now, no ideas come, the motivation isn't there. Most days I just work, come home and browse the internet mindlessly. For the record: I have been going to therapy pretty much all this year.

So, how were you able to get past this point, if anyone out there has?"
920,depression,Finally accepted that I’m depressed,"I’ve been telling myself for a while that I’ve just had a shit week for about a year now. I stay up late to avoid the next day, when I wake up I’m the morning I’m already dreading the day even if I have nothing to do. It’s crazy that I just now found this sub and relate to all the things people are saying. I act all happy and put smiles on for people who probably don’t care much about me and I don’t know why. I live with my mom and stepdad and if I told them how I feel I’d probably be ridiculed and be told “there’s no way you’re depressed you have it so easy” and I don’t want to deal with that so I’ll keep it to myself. Idk what to do but I guess admitting it is a good start so yah. Good night everyone love you all ❤️"
921,depression,👁👄👁✌️ a cry for help,"

So I’ve basically come to the realization that I’m pathetic. Like I’ve been sitting here for an hour just crying about how much my life sucks, when my life is wonderful. My biggest issue in life was just having some passed down issues and an eating disorder when I was younger, but now while I still struggle with eating disorder related thoughts, I can never go through with them anymore. Same with self harm. And because I can’t bring myself to do those things I know that my mental state isn’t that bad. But why do I feel so lonely all the time? Like I absolutely hate myself, all I do is lay around and whine about how much I suck. I never go out and I always push people away. When I was younger I told myself if I ever weighed over 200 pounds I’d kill myself, and I recently found out I’ve actually reached that goal! But I don’t want to kill myself. I just want to sleep. 
I know that no one can help me, because all of my “issues” are all my fault. Only I can change them, but I feel like I just can’t. Like losing weight, I just don’t know how to eat without going all or nothing. In my head I know all I need to do is stop eating like I did before, but whenever I do I feel worthless. Food has become the only thing in life that makes me semi happy, and then I always hate myself afterwards because I ate. Like tf is wrong with me? Am I really that stupid? I need someone to slap some sense into me, but I feel like once that happens I’ll be too sensitive to take it, and idk, just cry? Cause that’s all I ever feel like doing. 
Is it normal to feel this way? 

Sorry for the rant I have no one to talk to 🙁"
922,depression,"Everyone says that they wouldn’t kill them sleeves because their mom would be sad, but it’s the complete opposite for me.","If I ever killed myself it would be because of her. She has broken my family apart and verbally and mentally abuses me, my sister, and my dad yet still acts like the victim.
The first time I really experienced what it was like to be a part of a normal and healthy family I cried.
I don’t know how I’ve lived like this for 17 years. I just want it to end."
923,depression,I feel robbed.,"Everyone around me is a constant reminder of what I could be like, or what I could've been. Light, happy and carefree. I could make plans with friends without feeling like deadweight or a burden. I could string sentences, make coherent thoughts without self-doubt or feeling dim-witted. I could finish tasks without feeling exhausted in the middle of doing them. I could be motivated, I could have purpose without feeling like a fucking corpse. I feel like my brain has given up before my body can, and I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. I'm justifying my life because it's too complicated to die, what about my belongings? what about my family? 

 I feel fucking robbed, and all for what? For what exactly? I've been trying, I've been putting effort, but this requires more effort than I'm capable of giving.

I don't expect anyone to read this. Truthfully, I've made one too many posts that have been deleted now. I must do this out of pain. Sometimes it'd be easier knowing I'm unwanted and make no difference than to be caught in a place where I don't know what consequences will arise out of wanting to put myself out of my own misery. 

I don't know. I can pour my heart out anywhere, but it doesn't change a damn thing."
924,depression,Thoughts on lexapro?,Thoughts on lexapro? Is it better than Zoloft?
925,depression,I'm almost 30 and still depressed,"I'm going to try and keep it short here 

I have no friends I mean literally zero. My family and I have never been close and honestly I don't see us ever being close. They sent me to a psych ward twice and sort of permanently ruined any sort of trust i had. They think I'm crazy and the doctors said I wasn't.

Now I live at home still with a good(decent) paying job and have acquired a decent savings balence over the past year. I could probably afford a  place of my own.

The thing is It wouldn't make me happy and I know it. I have no friends or family. I'm literally just going through the motions. I'm greatful to have a job given the situation in the world right now, but at the same time I feel even more sad when a lot of the people I do know are just playing video games not working.  

Its just all so stressful now given the pandemic and I'm just overly depressed and have been for decades. I'd say it started when I was 9 or 10years old (not sure why) 

I'm never going to have kids. I am never going to have friends. I don't even enjoy watching TV shows or movies. I've been playing video games so I don't go completely insane but I don't even feel like doing that really. Like I said I am going through the motions and I have a feeling it's going to feel like this for the next 70 years. 

Just had to get that out there."
926,depression,Why am I not good enough,"Ever since I was a kid I've always felt that I'm only valid as a person if I do well, whatever the fuck that means. I've always been too lazy to be the best but just smart enough to scrape through above average. Always being bullied for shit I cant control. I'm sorry I forgot to do my homework, do you really think I want to be beat?

I remember breaking down into tears whenever i would get a score of 70% or lower, or if I handed something in late, or if i forgot about something. Cause I knew that the only way to be happy was to succeed.

My brothers and I were punished and shouted at when we got angry, and fair enough, we were assholes. But sometimes they would get punished for being depressed. I was so scared to tell my parents cause I've seen what they did to my brothers, and I only told them so I could get a proper diagnosis and have therapy covered by healthcare. And I wish I never told them.

I'm not good enough, I've never been good enough. I'm not smart enough, I'm not happy enough, I'm just a fucked up kid who's trying to run away from her problems by moving away.

And guess what

I might have to move back in cause my university course is all online and I dont have the funds to support myself during lockdown.

I cant do anything right, I cant even look after myself."
927,depression,what is the point of hanging on?,"the only reason I'm hanging on is because of how my family and friends will react. at what point does it become about me enough where killing myself doesn't matter if I fit into the model? if I'm supposed to spend the next 70+ years of my life suffering so that 10 people don't, what is the point? Im really reaching the final stage where I give up completely."
928,depression,"""It's just in your personality to not finish things""","I've heard this exact statement thousands of times from my mother. I was a college dropout on three different occasions before I actually finished something. Even then I took something with good prospects of work and pay rather than anything I have any passion for.

I don't always finish what I start but is that a personality trait or is it the result of years of soul crushing depression? Is it because of the intense fear of failure I feel because I was scrutinized under a microscope by my family and others around me for my entire life?

It isn't as simple as laziness or a lack of discipline. Within the past year I told mental health professionals I didn't give a fuck if I died or not. I'm not suicidal at the moment but I'm completely indifferent to the thought of death. I've come around some with the help of anti-depressants and occasional therapy sessions but I'm no beacon of happiness or contentment.

If that's the stage of my life that I'm at, how can I find any motivation or discipline? I've spent my whole adult life functionating purely out of obligation. I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted forcing myself each and every day to get out of bed let alone pursue anything that'll lead to any happiness.

I am not lazy."
929,depression,I’m going to sit alone at lunch all fucking year I’m so God damn lonely,"I don’t have many friends and I’m really not outgoing at all, but one thing I’ve always had is lunch. A short period 5 days a week where I don’t feel so lonely. This year I don’t have that. Which I know people are going through a lot worse but it feels like I just lost the only time I’m really happy. I just know that I will be sitting alone in the library or bathroom everyday of school and idk man it just fuckings sucks and I’m breaking down. I’ve already contacted the school and a lunch change just isn’t possible. I feel like I’m at the lowest point of my fucking life and I can’t even have that hour of happiness anymore. Fuck man. I’m sick of being so God damn lonely you know what I mean? Anyone who’s been in similar situations know how to deal with this? Or what to do during that period? Fuck man fuck this."
930,depression,How do i stop comparing myself to others?,"I really want to be happy, but i don't know what makes me truly happy and fills that void in my soul.

934,depression,I'm 16 and I'm depressed because of the possibility of having OCD,"Hey, you can call me River. I have a story I want to share, it's all about my depression and how I got into becoming depression, the first time I was depressed I was 10 years old and i was suicidal for a year, almost attempting suicide 4 times, I'm not suicidal anymore of course, but the last five years of my life was great, until April 6th 2020, I had my first intrusive image/thoughts which is basically a unwanted thought that causes emotional distress, well, my intrusive thought was so bad I went into a depressive episode and I'm still stuck in it, I have been stuck being depressed for four months already. It's about to turn into five months after this month passes, I'm worried I will never be happy and I'm also worried about the fact I have been depressed TWICE before the age of 18, what does that mean of my future? Does that mean by the time I'm 28 i will be depressed four times? I really don't know, but, I'm deciding to not tell my friends about my depression, why would I drag them down into depression too? Why make them worried too? I care more about my friends than I care about myself, because, I relie on them for support and right now they aren't here, why would I make them depressed with me? Then we will have two depression people to worry about you know. I don't have severe depression, it's clinical but it's only moderate depression it used to be severe at some point but I'm getting better, that's all I have to say, remember I believe in you guys and I wish you the best.♥️"
935,depression,Reading what I write is the worst,"For a whole now, when I've been in a bad place I just type a stream of thought type thing into a notepad file on my computer and whenever I look through it I just feel terrible. I see how stupid I was being over such minor things, how selfish I guess I can be and how overly dramatic and goddamned stupid I get. It's just the first words that pop up and it's like I'm talking to myself and it's made me realise that I fucking hate having to listen to me"
936,depression,any tips when talking to a therapist?,"I've been seeing my therapist for probably 2 years now and at the beginning, she asked if I wanted problem-solving or if I just wanted to talk and she listened. Of course, I said talk and listening and that's what it's been for 2 years every other week. And I'm okay with that, kind of.

Before our meeting, I plan a list of all these things actually bothering me in my head. I'm like yes I'm going to talk to her about my depression and all this stuff. Then I get there and talk about my boyfriend and the problems I have with his family which doesn't even involve me at all I just hate their toxic family.

But it's the same pattern every week, I have something that really bothers me and makes me upset but I never mention it to my therapist. I don't know how to bring up that I want to talk about that stuff."
937,depression,Just a poem about loving someone,"I was lost for so long 
But then you came back 
And I was found again 

You took me in 
Took a chance but I failed you again 
Now we sit and try to figure out 
Where to begin again 

I hurt you you hurt me there’s pain again 

I lay awake wishing I was dead again 
So I can’t feel love again

In your arms is where I felt safe 
But now you’re gone again 

I get little pieces of you and for that I’m thankful
I just need you to be mine again 

To feel whole again 
We see each other it all goes away again
Let yourself feel for me again 

Look me into my eyes
And fall even more in love with me again 

It can be that simple if you just let us be again
I promise I won’t ever you hurt again 
That would only hurt me again 

And I won’t make you cry again 
Unless I’m making you happy again

I know you’re scared again 
To feel vulnerable again 
To put yourself out there again

Give us one more chance to be again
And I promise it won’t be the same again

My love for you is true and will always be 
It’s been you and I won’t fuck it up again

I know it’s still there I can feel it again 
Your actions speak louder than words 
I can see again 
You’re opening up again 

I’m that much closer I can almost reach you again 
Let’s pick up the pieces 
And put them back together again"
938,depression,Tired of everything,"I'm just tired of everything. Tired of trying, of going to work, of trying to finish school.

**It all seems pointless** since everything I'm doing is **not** what I want to do, and I don't know what I want to do with my life. We're all told of how to live but not asked how we want to live. That we need to graduate college, get a job, get married, retire, and die. But honestly, I hate going to college and I would hate working at some corporation, but I just feel so lost.

Of course, you might say ""it's easy just don't do it and do what you want to do"". But maybe I don't want to be a loser, who drops out of college and does nothing with his life. I don't even know what I would do besides this.

I'm sure this is common and many of you might have experienced it. I would just like to hear your thoughts on this subject. Thank you, peace."

941,depression,Life is a constant fight and eventually I'm going to lose,"I like to think of myself as a competitor. Stubborn too. Someone who would go to great lengths in order to win. That's what's been driving me since high school. I do the things I need to do in anger and frustration. I will not let this person be better than me, stronger than me, faster than me, better-looking than me, the list goes on. But once in a while I'll hit a wall and realize ""yeah, fhey are better than me"". And it sucks. I lose faith in myself and it all starts to fall. I dread the day I see them succeeding, becoming rich and popular because, to be honest, when that day comes, I'll probably kill myself.

Does anybody else ""function"" not because they want to but because they NEED to or else you will truly lose it all?"
942,depression,Am i going to regret this,I've been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. I tried getting a love life going but I get so jealous when my girlfriend talks with other guys and it never works out. My bestfriend has been with me for years helping me through the struggle. And now I did the one thing I never wanted to happen. I caught feelings for her and I get jealous every time she talks with my friend. I blocked the other guy who has been my home for 2 years. But now I think she likes him and I feel like blocking her. She's been helping me for years and if I do this I'm not going to have anyone left. But at the same time I can't see her be with him. This sounds really childish but I'm serious it hurts my soul and all I can think about is dying.

I just wanted to tell everyone that if you feel ""off"" its ok to ask for help.  Its something I kept putting off, I kept telling myself ""it will go away"". It never it. It lingered. I tried to ignore it. It got to a point where I could not.

It built up.

I lashed out at my SO. I had days where I could not stop crying. I was certain it would stop.

Then the thought came to me, it was like a whisper, then it grew louder in my mind. Everyone would be better off without me. I thought about how all their lives would be, if they didn't have to deal with me.

Wait. No. This was wrong. This isn't me. Cue another breakdown. What's wrong with me? I needed help. I made an appointment.

Then I had what felt like one of the most difficult conversations with my SO. I told them what I feared, all of it, how I tried to ignore it. I had an appointment. I felt anxious. They may not have understood. But they were there, they listened. It was no ones fault. It just happened.

The doctor listened. Prescribed medication. I had another appointment in a month. 

I finally reached normality. 

I went for my check in a week ago. Things are good. I have debated if I wanted to share or not. I hope someone might read this that might need it.

These thoughts are non stop. Why don’t they go away? I don’t want to say it’s an obsession because it’s not. But it has affected so much of my life. I’ve never accomplished anything, haven’t done any of the things I so desperately desire because I feel like there’s no point in working hard to accomplish the things I want because I’m not going to be here long so it’s not worth the effort.

I'm just a real piece of shit when I'm depressed. I don't have the tools to deal with how I feel. I'm unable to articulate to people what I'm going through or how to properly express it, nor have a found a good outlet for those feelings. So I do what I learned from my dad growing up; be passive aggressive. Be angry at everyone, including yourself. Guilt trip everyone. I need a therapist, but I haven't been able to find one yet.

Seeing this hurts because my life is also falling apart. I have high expectations that I probably won’t get to fulfill. School is another waste of time. And adults these days blame technology for everything instead of moving forward. They think it’s the root of depression or anxiety. Truth is none of those are true. We all have to realize it’s a way to view what’s going on and a way to communicate. It’s not the technology but what we do with it. I’m too different i want to be in a relationship but I also don’t, I just want to be unbothered the rest of my life. I have heavy anxiety and depression maybe it’s not the technology it’s the school system and the parents that expect so much from us. This world needs to change. Before you know it we will have ourselves extinct by our own cause. The people of back then misunderstand a lot of things nowadays. This new generation might not be the best but we are also the most open minded. Nobody is probably gonna read this but I hope it relates to you. Stop the racism it’s stupid fighting over a color or a race we look stupid as fuck doing this. I hope everyone finds a good life. My faith in humanity will never come back. We might have a brain and know how to use it. But animals that can’t do what we do seem better then us. And also just tell the school system stop teaching worthless shit, I learn more here then there. I just wish for peace and unity. -P"

958,depression,Family is the Worst Burden,"I live with almost all of my immediate family. I'm in the same house as my Aunt and her three children, my dad lives in a camper behind the house and my grandma and grandpa live together in the house that my uncle had bought for them so they could live with him. We are all on the same property. Living together is hard because there are so many people but it has gotten even worse ever since corona started because now I have no escapes, I could go into the woods but there's no point, there's no joy in that escape anymore.

 I've started doing homeschooling for this year and I plan to do it until I graduate but my grandma is the worst when it comes to controlling my life and putting me down. I'm taking fewer classes than I would do in a normal schooling year so I can keep my stress levels low because I have anxiety and I want to make life a little easier for myself. My grandma has not let me have 5 minutes of rest for weeks, I've been trying to get ahead this week but it's not working out because I have harder work than I was expecting and had to redo some assignments 3 times to get anything over a D. Even though I am ahead of where I need to be for this week, my grandma started yelling at me while I was helping my aunt, when I couldn't try to avoid the scream fest that makes me want to curl away and die every single time it happens. She said I was never going to go anywhere, that I was going to be a dropout and useless like my father, that I never do anything and I'm a lazy piece of trash for not being a week or more ahead on my classes. I'm being forced to get extra work done and I'm not allowed to sleep until I get enough done for her.

Her being around when I'm trying to do school makes me feel like a disappointment and I haven't stopped crying since this morning while trying my best to get through assignments. I'm too young to move out, I have no job because I'm trying to focus on school even though she's constantly yelled at me to get a job while also saying I'm not doing enough in school and that I need to get a job to work during the day and start doing school at night.

I don't know what to do anymore, I'm at my breaking point because I've been yelled at my whole life and put down for so long that I don't think there is an escape from my life. I have no friends because I became one with a toxic person and now I'm alone with my thoughts, school, and a family that doesn't let me breathe. I just needed to rant and get it all of my chest, I have no one else to talk to that won't yell at me besides Reddit, so thank any of you who read this, if you want, you can give advise though I don't think there's much I can do.

My ex-spouse used me for money and a place to live. The current people in my life use me for the same. I’m tired of it, I’m tired of being used.

I’m laying in my bed at 3am wishing for this all to end. I’ve been depressed for so long I can’t remember. Nothing is fun to me anymore, nothing excites me. The only thing that rouses me anymore is the thoughts of doing violence to them. I’m tired of being used. I want to unleash all of my rage. Make them feel all of my depression. I try to work out daily to contain it. I’m not sure it’s working anymore.

If it wasn’t for my kids I know I would be dead by now. I can’t think of them seeing me dead, I don’t want them to suffer what I’m going through. I think for years I tried to numb this feeling with alcohol, but what happens when you have to stop drinking. Should I even be concerned about that now?

I told a close group of friends that I’ve been feeling suicidal some time ago at the advice if my therapist to create a support group. And honestly I’m not sure any of them even paid enough attention to me to care and nothing was ever said. My career is useless and my job, I’m just a number there.

969,depression,When life keeps surprising you,"Throwaway account, 20 m

Don't you just love it when you think you're at the lowest point of your entire sorry ass life (talking about myself here, hopefully not spreading negativity) but it somehow keeps curb stomping you harder and harder each time?

For the first time in my life I'm at a point where I think of actually killing myself. I spend my entire day waking up, crying, waiting for night so I can cry once more and fall asleep.

The worst part about suicidal thoughts for me, is the fact that I would do it in a heartbeat if I didn't worry about my family and friends (I'll get to this in a second). They're the only ones stopping me. I've even thought about faking an accident, thinking that might make it less painful for them, as they don't have to think whether they could have saved me.

Anyway, my life might seem amazing (it even does so to myself) I live in a country with no crime, no natural disasters, the virus hasn't affected us at all basically.
I also have amazing friends, and a lot of them, as well as an amazing family.
I've lost an immense amount of weight to the point I went from obese to average weight with a decent amount of muscles.

So why would I even think about something like suicide? 

Not even sure where it started, suppose I'll just list some shit off that keeps bringing up tears lately

So the longest lasting one (there's been earlier incidents or issues but this one has lasted the longest without getting solved) is my gambling addiction. I did it to myself but hey, it ruined a huge part of my life, I even struggle buying potatoes which go for cents per kg

That curb stomping I talked about? The first hit was kind of mysterious, just random feelings of emptiness and sadness hitting like a rock.

Next hit? Best friend dies in freak accident.

When you think nothing else can go wrong, life throws a curveball by giving you the chance to live your life to the fullest, as I received the job offer of my dreams, but get an instant call back saying they actually had someone reserved they forgot about.

Life is pretty much at absolute zero, I don't feel happy for even half a second of my days, and surely enough a fucking bird shits on my head, can you believe it? Some straight up cartoon shit.

Anyway it's all fun and games until another friend dies to a heart attack and another one kills herself as it was her husband. That's when you realise the world is actually collapsing around you.

It's not even half of the shit that's happened, I've probably missed some pretty huge ""incidents"" simply because I try to forget them.

I wish I could somehow let everyone know how i wouldn't suffer if I took my life, it would only make everything better. It would take a lot of weight off their shoulders if they knew I was happy for a moment after going through with it

For now, I live an empty life full of only sadness and self hate. Crying being my main activity, as movies and games and working out have lost all meaning to me. I could just as well be staring at a wall, the feeling is the exact same."
970,depression,I wasn’t fully aware of how bad my depression was after today.,"*Note: English is not my first language, so I’m sorry for any grammar/punctuation mistakes.

I’m a 20 (almost 21) year old female with diagnosed depression. I don’t really go to therapy (only if I feel if it’s necessary ) and I’m on anti-depressants that I take every day. 

Because of my symptoms, I thought it wasn’t really “that” bad. My symptoms are the typical ones, such as:

  - Being tired all day and having sleeping problems
  - Eating way too much and gaining weight rapidly
  - Feeling sad (over my dad’s death in 2016)
  - Feeling hopeless
  - Not really doing anything fun anymore and wanting     to be alone all the time. (I even wait for my mom and little brother to finish their dinner so I can sit alone at the table. I know, weird. I’ve just always been quite the loner, lol.)

As you can see, I’m not suicidal and I don’t want to hurt myself and never have. Maybe I sound stupid, but I always thought that those were the symptoms that made it a severe depression. I was under the impression that I was moderately depressed. 

So, just about an hour ago I was bored and decided to learn a little bit more about depression. I read articles and studies for a little while. I also did a few quizzes (just for the fun of it) and they all said I probably had severe depression. Which, to me, was very interesting. Again, I thought that wanting to hurt oneself/being suicidal were the symptoms that made it a severe depression. 

I’ve been thinking about it for a little, and it makes sense that I have severe depression. It has made my daily life a struggle and I even started to get somewhat distant to all my friends, including my best friend, who(m?) I’ve known for 10 years. As I said before, I’ve gained a lot of weight and barely do anything on my days off, other then lay in bed and be on either, Reddit or Youtube on my phone. If I’m not doing that, I’m sleeping. At work, (I work retail 3 days every week.) I’m really tired and sometimes even really slow.

I’ve been doing a little better lately, though, and I’ve been trying to go out more, do more fun things and make new friends. Don’t worry, I’m wearing a mask and maintaining distance. I even fully restored my friendship with my best friend and I speak to her every day. Whereas before we would text every few months and meet up very rarely. I’ve also been taking my driving lessons and I’m super close to getting my license. Before, I was very scared of starting my lessons because my dad passed away in a motorcycle accident, so it made me anxious to start driving.
 
Maybe I’m just really stupid for not realizing this sooner, lol. But I just thought it was very interesting and wanted to share! If you don’t really know much about your depression, I really suggest researching it because it’s actually very interesting. And a little extra knowledge wouldn’t hurt, right?

*Edit grammar mistakes :/"
971,depression,Feeling incredibly depressed despite how well life is going...,"Hey y’all, I just needed a place to vent and get this out. I’ve struggled with depression my entire life, but it’s weighing on me now more than ever. Generally when I’m depressed there is a reason, be it work, family or other stressful situations, but right now I’m feeling it worse than ever and for no apparent reason at all. Life is going better than ever (besides the whole COVID thing). 

I’m making great money, I have a healthy wife and kids and healthy relationships with them, and we are buying our first home. Yet I feel lost. I feel worried and shaky. I feel hopeless. I feel like a failure. My brain is telling me to cry, but also at the same time I feel numb and physically can’t cry. I’ve been sitting behind my computer all day trying to force myself to work, but I can’t. I just can’t do anything. I can’t even force myself to eat without feeling nauseous. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I’m feeling this way. I just needed to get it out. It’s hard for me to tell friends or family what I’m going through because I feel guilty for being depressed since things are going well. They just wouldn’t understand it."
972,depression,Is it healthy to find peace in imagining yourself in fictional worlds?,"I’ve noticed this pattern with my depression over the years. When it gets really bad for me I’ll find a show I really enjoy and imagine myself as one of the characters. I’ll make up different stories about the show in my head when I’m having bad depression days and it helps me get through bad times. Right now I’m really invested into the Avatar series.

Do you think this is a healthy coping mechanism? Do you guys do this at all?"
973,depression,COVID has fucked me mentally,"Ever since COVID happened I haven't been able to move outside my home . Especially because of living in a country like India where the entire government is full of scam artists pretending to solve the problem in a few days. The number of cases where I live is at it's **peak.** 

&gt;I have felt I always had 2 sides an introvert  quiet ,calm side and a wild side that needs freedom more than anything else. Living in the same room without being able to experience the sunshine or experience the smell of the rain or walking pon the road has me completely shattered mentally.

Moreover ,I realize *playing video games* or *watching Netflix* all day long isn't gonns fix that rather it is gonna aggravate that.I have also tried to distract myself using the above techniques that just not help at all.

**Also I do not have any friend's at alll**.I have never been  the person who has had group of friends. Due to my multiple interests I have kinda mixed along with multiple sets of groups often not wanting to chose one group. However, this has left me isolated most of the time since I feel in the end I don't have someone to talk to or anyone to actually hang out with. This is really aggravayed by COVID again because the people whom I used to talk to no longer talk with me at all and also due to different schedules.

**I feel like I'm in a loop** . Just wake up eat , question life , feel sorry and wish COVID goes away and sleep.

**I have gained 10 kgs** of weight and **injured my leg doing these stupid home workouts** which are not as effective as actual workouts in an actual gym .I miss the gym dearly.Feel like shit carrying that weight around and not being able to workout properly or visit a doctor because these fucking doctors mis-treat patients too.

I cannot handle my stupid parents . **They just cannot seem to understand that depression is real** and my relationship with them is extremely toxic although there is no love lost , there is no compatibility at all. I feel like I'm trapped at home with people who just don't understand me and do not value mental health and think of it as just another attention.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not feel like coding at all. I just don't feel like learning anything at all. I wish I could have a gap year where I could pursue what I wanted. **Also being forced to enter into a Masters program because of leaving the country is a much better alternative than living somewhere you are just treated as fucking statistic.**  

I fucking hate my country . I hate the people here and the mindset of the people.  I hate my fucking unversity which is a big scam. I feel like I want to droput and pursue something related to coding or maybe artisitic on my own but this degree and parents won't ever support or accept the fact that I could do something other than CS.

**I just do not feel like eating , or doing anything. I feel extremely depressed.**

&gt;All my life I have never been able to be around people who share a similar mindset to me and have extremely different interests and passionate about them . All people seem to care about are grades and nothing remotely related to humans or actually. I just feel I wish I had chosen a better university where I had people who wanted to pursue something related to research. However ,this scam of a country does not promote research among undergrads as well. The only people able to pursue this are for the Tier 1 ,2 unis where the profs actually know some shit. This shitty university of mine is forcing to sit for placements into mass recruiting company's and try going to FAANG. Fuck I do not want to become an SDE . I wish I could do something remotedly related to original research. All the research they seem to know is copy paste from google  ,bribe recruiteres and conference judges for paper acceptances. Which feels like a **big scam.**

I have absolutely no motivation left whatsoever . I wish COVID goes away and I can heal both physically and mentally . I just cannot seem to work despite knowing the problems I could face for not acting whatever I have planned out."

Life has been diffidcult lately because of covid and classes being online. I was really looking forward to living on campus and having a social life. I feel like i havent had a social life all my teenage years. Honest to god thats my fault for not respecting myself and leaving situations that were toxic for me. I honestly want nothing right now except to go back in time and form a proper social circle. I really dont want to be in college. During my freshman year i walked around campus feeling depressed realizing that there was no true community in college. It was something that you had to make up for yourself. Classes being online this semester is soooo depressing because it means that by the time i get to live on campus, i will be almost halfway done with school:( I was already depressed about the uni im going to because it wasn't my top choice or anything"
977,depression,Depression = Losing intelligence,"The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. 

It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.

EDIT: This blew up over night, I'm thankful for the lively discussion in the comments, thanks for the awards. May you all find a way to get rid of this. Lots of love."

980,depression,Hi. I’m 25 and I don’t know what to do with my life. Work &amp; Depression &amp; Lifestyle,"Hi guys. A few weeks ago I turned 25 and I had a crisis. I've never written on reddit before but I i really don’t know what to do with my fkg life.

I was born in Andorra. Is a small place between France and Spain and is where I live now.

I still live with my parents, the only family I have. My father works at a gas station and he's a little bitter and toxic, but he is a good person. My mother works cleaning houses, she is very cheerful, but she doesn't care about anything. I don’t have Friends. I don’t have a boyfriend I’m not able to keep a relationship more than 3 months.

My dog died almost a year ago, it was old I had it since I was 8 years old. He was one of the few friends I had. Also recently my grandmother died of Alzheimer's and my grandfather of grief. My grandfather went to a mass grave because my family did not want to pay for more burials. They lived in Spain and there funeral homes are a mafia.

Also I don’t like my body even when I am very ripped &amp; aesthetic. My weight and body composition can vary a lot from year to year. Maybe I'm 56 kg and super aesthetic or 82kg super fat with the same gym weightlifting routine. Cause the problem is that I eat a lot for anxiety.

I left business administration carer cause I don’t liked it, I forgotten all I learn and I didn’t see myself working on it. (Although if I really think about it, I prefer it over working in the places where I have worked) I know there are other careers that catch my attention which I can't study here. They are very expensive outside my country. I went to the psychologist for depression but I left it in the middle without warning because I couldn't afford it. I feel like I want to cry anytime, anywhere, even when it should be okay. I feel a lot of anxiety.

I've been unemployed for half a year. I have been working in a bad places. The last job I had, I was working between 8 and 14 hours a day as a night security guard 6 days per week. I left it because as soon as they discovered my sexual orientation they began to lose respect for me and I couldn't take it there anymore.

What worries me the most is ending up working a bad place bitterly watching life go by. Life is too short and the last 5 years have flown by. I would like to feel useful. I would like to feel like a normal person. I feel the need of having a career I like or at least a nice job.

To forget everything I live a virtual life in World of Warcraft like a therapy. I can easily spend all day locked in my room playing. But when I leave it, life hits me, reality hits me, And that is why I write this, I know I have to change but I don't know how to start. Any advice would be great."

Nope. Weird - when I seem better I'm actually so much worse.

Anyway, to all my friends who stopped bothering to talk to me or see me before tonight - don't worry about it. I know I'm selfish and horrible, blah blah blah - I'm dead. About time you saw how evil I actually am.

To the one person who sees this in new, I love you. I have so much compassion and hope for someone I don't even know. I know you'll ace that test, I know you'll talk to that person eventually, I know you'll do amazing. Unlike me.

Stay safe,

985,depression,Living is so much fucking effort,"Just thinking about everything I have to do to survive makes me not want to live. Theres so much expectations and pressure and just things that you need to do or else you'll end up dead or homeless or some shit and I barely have the energy to brush my teeth regularly so basically I'm fucked. 
Every time I have a psychiatrist appointment one of the stupid ass questions they ask is ""do you have joy in your life?"" And honestly at this point my answer would be fuck no."
986,depression,How much would I have to pay to lose weight?,"How much would I have to pay to have someone kidnap me, lock me in an athletic facility where I’m told what exercises to do and provide me with food according to an actual diet for a month or longer? 

I only ask because I’ve tried dieting and going to the gym, I’ve tried picking up activities to exercise, I’ve tried just starving myself. No matter what, after about 2-3 weeks I just fall off. I have no discipline and no ability to control myself when it comes to dieting/exercising. I’m currently in a severe depression, and weight is just adding another reason I want to kill myself. I’ve tried a couple of times recently, but if I end up in the hospital, I just convince the psychiatrist that I’m fine, that it wasn’t an attempt or that I have actual support systems or whatever they want to hear."
987,depression,Not suicidal but wouldn't be mad if I died,"As I grew older there were more negatives than positives and there were more unbearable than bearable days. 

So much so that I am not affirmatively suicidal but if I died through no action of my own, I would feel relieved. Life is tiring, plagued with problems. Hardly any ups and we are confirmed many downs. There's nothing much left to hold on to. 

Is this a problem or something a lot of us have in common?

Edit : I deleted all social media apps from my phone the day I posted this, So I am now logging in to many comments from people feeling the same way. I've not found a way to tackle this problem, I've just simply lost the will to live and there's no quick solution to finding meaning in a life. However, I do hope I'll be able to refocus and make this life purposeful. I hope the same for you too, if you've read the original post and feel the same. Thanks for the support."
988,depression,Being depressed and having depression are different.,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. 


Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye

Edit: I’m really happy this post caused some awesome conversations hopefully made people feel less alone in the fact that you can be depressed about nothing. 🥰"
989,depression,I just want a hug,I'm having an intense wave of emotion rn. I hate myself and I want to die so badly.
990,depression,Depression goes away when I don't have to work on my thesis or think about the future,"I'm 26 and I'm overthinking and not really a happy person since my childhood. When I went to university 7 years ago I had big problems to manage all the stuff and to do the exams. I was depressed maybe 10 month of the year and in the remaining two month I studied, but also was not really happy. 

In the end I managed so get trough my bachelor and now I'm working on my master thesis. But the last 7 years were really bad and I wanted to change something. In the last months I managed to form some good habits. I'm working out a lot, I meditate, get enough sleep and eat clean. 

I plan every day and reserve about 4-8 hours a day to work on my master thesis. But there comes the problem. I feel really bad if I have to work on it. Also it reminds me that after I finish it I have to apply for jobs and have to work a minimum of 40 hours a week. Then everything gets ""real"". And thats the moment were I feel depressed again. If I force myself for some days then it gets even worse and even my good habits fall apart.

So I'm in dilemma. If I don't have to work I feel good and even think positive about the future or working on the thesis or jobs. But if I actually have to do something it gets worse fast and I'm not able to work on it at all. In the end I don't really know if I'm just not made for a mentally challening job (intelligent enough though) or that my mind is messed up from all the years doing just the minimum. Most people would just describe this behaviour as ""lazy"". And this is how most teachers would describe me.

How do I get out of this circle?"

992,depression,"Thesis, depression and loneliness is really fucking me up.","So I've been stuck on my Thesis for 1.5-years. I'm finding it impossible to finish. Everything is so bad about it and I hate working on it. I've suspended my studies with depression because my thesis was going so bad. And a year later, it's still really bad. 


So the whole duration of the 1.5-years I've been mad depressed and unable to move on with my life. I barely leave my house or do anything because I have the thesis looming over my head.

This has led me to become incredibly lonely. I can't socialise with anyone because I feel so fucked from how bad my thesis is. I just want to move on with my life, but I can't seem to finish the writing it. It's taken soooooooo long to finish and it's so bad. 


I don't know what to do! I feel so fucked."

1003,bipolar,Everyone talking about hypersexuality,"*TLDR At the end.* 
And here I am constantly searching why I’m dead inside and don’t experience sexual attraction. I’ve had sex, I’m married. I just honestly never think about it. I mostly -only want sex when I’m manic or in an extremely good place in life. I feel extremely guilty for not pleasing my partner as often as I wish. 

Hyposexuality:


Someone with hyposexuality may experience symptoms such as:

a complete lack of interest in sex
feeling physically unattractive or undesirable
a disinterest in personal hygiene or grooming
feeling vulnerable or worthless sexually, which may keep them from engaging
physical exhaustion, which makes sex difficult
The person may also feel guilty about their lack of sexual desire, which could feed the cycle of self-doubt and feeling undesirable.

TLDR; hypersexuality is such a common topic in bipolar disorder. Hyposexuality is also a thing and no one bats an eye."
1005,bipolar,Is it normal to question whether or not the past actually happened?,"TL;DR at the bottom

My friend sent me a picture of my ex from her friends VSCO, and I kind of shut down for a while because I started questioning whether or not I even met this person. I genuinely don’t know what parts of the past few years of my life were reality or were fabricated in my head. I feel like it was all real? But I keep asking myself do I even know this person? Did I ever talk to her? Touch her? I’m starting to wonder what if it actually happened and what didn’t. I went through old pictures on my phone, examined a gift I made for her but never gave, and I just don’t know why im having trouble remembering it? I see pictures of us together with no memory of it happening whatsoever. It could be my DDD (derealization depersonalization disorder) but I don’t know. I’m calling my psychiatrist in the morning to ask her about this. Have any of you experienced something similar?

TLDR: I’m losing my grip of the past, what happened, what didn’t, and I don’t know why. Has anyone else experienced this?"

I got called to the front to check people out, and I wiped my eyes and put on my brave face.

I just got home from leaving early due to my anxiety. Ive been crying on and off since then. I looked in the mirror to brush my hair and theres glitter all under my eyes. I guess the tears were like glue.

When you laugh so loud, your parents will say ""hey did you took your anti-psychotics?"" and thats SAD. When i just starre at on spot for few moments, they say the same thing and thats SAD. When i'm drowned in sea of sadness &amp; just want to die, girlfriend says hey let's hang out! you know what happens if i don't say OK... and thats SAD. When i see my mom came back from work, she  start looking at me like a additional person and a boring person. she dosen't talks to me like before time, she got tired of me for being a superman for a week? and a few months being a person who can't get off from the damb bed. i do really try to pretend that i'm a normal person to make her or my dad smile but i cant't, and that's SAD. I'm a huge fan of Thrash Metal and Death Metal music, actually i wrote many songs. Fact : i'm a intermediate electric guitar and bass player, and idiot people start saying ""this style of music made you sick"" and that's SAD. That has nothing to do with biopolar and really helps me to get rid of my anger &amp; sorrow with this beautiful music! you can't cry or desire for just a hug becuz you're a men and men will never cry ;( . and that's SAD just because we've born with damn bittersweet illness, so what? should i give a damn to your FULL HEALTHY MIND? Can't be what our influenses are? of course we can, aren't all of us humans? don't you have empathy?why elementary kindness became this much greedi and fake?

1014,bipolar,I am the God king,"I sit here in my throne (bed) thinking about all I've done. I've read books, painted, sung, danced  and this was just in an hour.  I almost impossibly shift moods and sink into a deep depression. If only I could stay manic enough to only think I was some God king."

That was my anxiety freaking out because I hadn’t seen you in 5+ years and my house was a mess and I didn’t know if your intentions were to actually catch up over a beer or what."
1018,bipolar,How did you discover you were Bipolar? Here's my story,"I overshare  a lot. I wanted to post here and explain my story to vent and so that maybe one person can avoid my struggles in psychiatry.

I had my first Panic Attack when I was 10, and have been depressed and suffered from GAD and ongoing panic attacks since I was 13. I've spoken to countless Psychiatrist who have had a hard time diagnosing me for a long time. As someone who has struggled a lot I learned a lot about   psychiatry, but I avoided bipolarity because it was very scary and foreign. I thought only crazy people where bipolar. (sorry)

I'm very hard to diagnose because I mask very hard. I don't seem sick to anyone, but I've always become extremely manic when I'm social and have periods where I go all-in on specific things. I'm crazy, I'm weird, I'm obnoxiously self confident, it's been obvious that I'm not normal to everybody around me, and in hindsight it's very obvious to me aswell. It's not normal for a couch potato to go from nothing to running a 7k in 2 weeks. I'm a very competitive gamer and I reach milestones very   easily in a couple of weeks to months that people struggle to achieve for years. I always thought I just had a natural talent once I commited to task, I now realize that this is very normal for somebody who is   manic. And I always thought, why don't I commit to just one game? I could be a professional gamer with ease! But it never seems to last. Then I get depressed and do nothing - and hate myself for it. I want to do so much, I have so many dreams and aspirations. Fuck, it's so annoying and so difficult.

I've never worked for anyone in my life, and I'm 27 years old now. I've just  somehow figured how to make money doing things online when I'm in my  manic episodes. WHY CANT I BE THIS WAY ALWAYS? If I could, I'd be the  overachiever who just wants people to like me, the person I know that I can be. I even managed to become a full time twitch streamer for years, after receiving my partnership only two weeks in. (feel free to PM me for my twitch channel for proof, even though it's been years since I   streamed)

Then I get depressed. And I suck. I avoid everyone. I considered myself and ""extroverted introvert"". I'm just bipolar. Even when I'm happy and manic the sadness always linger and is there. I feel fake and I don't know who I'm. Who am  I? I don't know. I still don't know.

I had my ""dream job"" - I was making money doing something I did to avoid real life, and my issues - playing video games. But I couldn't even motivate myself to do that once I became sick again.

I drink a lot. It's my way of coping, I love alcohol. I'm very sensitive to almost all medications, and even alcohol. I've always wondered why I feel the effects of almost all drugs significantly stronger than most. Is this a bipolar thing?

I just spent the couple of days reading everything I could about bipolarity after my new psychiatrist claimed the odds of me being bipolar is very   high, and I just have to say that all of you are so adorably relatable. This subreddit has made me feel normal, and in a weird way that makes me very sad. I just thought I was anxious and depressed and was hoping that I'd be able to ""fix"" myself, I now realize that I'll probably be this way for my whole life, hello crazies, I accept that I'm one of you now.

Which is weird in and off itself, because I never thought I'd become this old. I always told   myself I'd kill myself at 25 if I couldn't solve my issues, but I didn't. I'm still around. I think my best friend also has bipolar tendencies, she is so adorable and weird. And we have a blast together. I spoke to her about it today, and how we are so similar, she shares my experiences in a lot of ways, maybe this is why we have always gotten along so well - we share our overconfidence and weirdness that nobody else seems to understand.

I'm in a weird place right now. I have to admit to myself that I will be this way forever. Which is equally great as it's sad, because I love myself, I think I'm fucking great and hilarious! But at the same time I'm torn because I know that I'll probably experience the sadness I've had in my life for so long, forever.

Thank you for reading, if you find my story relatable feel free to reach out. I want more crazy fun people in my life that are similar to myself!

TLDR: Had panic anxiety and depression my whole life. Thought my manic episodes where a natural talent but realized I'm just bipolar. I'll always be the amazing sad person that I'm, and that's ok."
1019,bipolar,How to deal with side effects,"I’m in the middle of figuring out my treatment, my shrink thinks it’ll take 3-12 months before I’m stable. I just tried seroquil and it made me so dizzy and have double vision so bad that I couldn’t work. I work an hourly job; I can’t afford to just lose hours at the will of my pills. I am so scared of trying new medication now... every side effect that could affect my work scares me. When the seroquil first gave me double vision I was at home and I broke down crying because I’m at my wits end. I know my treatment is out there. I know I’ll get better. But I’m too scared to go on that journey... especially with my job on the line. Any advice on how to deal?"
2040,bipolar,I (33f) feel like my husband (47) treats me like a child because I’m bipolar.,"My husband and I have been married for 3 years. He’s been by far the most understanding supportive and compassionate partner that I’ve had. The problem is though that I’m starting to realize that he doesn’t treat me like his equal and in a way he treats me like I’m a child. 

When we first got married I went off my medication and it was a bit of a disaster. I promised him that I’d never do it again and I haven’t but everyday my husband asks if I’ve taken them, I say yes and then he checks to make sure that I’ve actually taken them. 

My husband is a financial manager so when we got married we agreed that he would be in charge of our finances. I have made some poor financial decisions in the past so at the time I felt  like this was a good thing but my husband is incredibly controlling with it, or at least that’s how I feel. We both work and have a “joint” bank account. I say “joint” because in reality it’s his bank account. My name is on it but he doesn’t let me have access to it. If you asked how much was in our bank account I wouldn’t be able to tell you. I have a credit card but I’m not allowed to use it without his permission, if I do he’ll take it away from me and I’ll have to earn it back. 

I’ve tried telling him that this bothers me and that I feel like he doesn’t trust me. He says he does this because he cares about me and loves me which is something I haven’t genuinely experienced before- I had an abusive childhood and all my relationships prior to him were extremely toxic."

2043,bipolar,I don't know if I can ever be in a relationship with me being Bipolar.,"Hi. First time posting something like this on Reddit. 

Where do I even begin? I feel so helpless and I don't know what to do or what to feel anymore.

I was diagnosed with bipolar (2) back in 2018. My mom took me to see a psychiatrist, wasn't really something I wanted to do but I knew I needed help. He prescribed me some meds for my bipolar and some pills to concentrate on my school work. I took the pills for about a month and a half but soon realized that it was fucking up my personality and mood, for example, my friend committed suicide, after his death, I wasn't really emotional about it, but a few days after his passing I was sitting in my room and I accidentally knocked my glass over and it broke, I was so mad that I could put a hole through a wall. After that incident, I stop taking the meds. Everything went back to normal with fewer manic episodes and depressive episodes. 

I got into a new relationship a few months later and realized that my depression and manic episodes started to spike again, I told my girlfriend at that time that I was diagnosed with bipolar a few months back and she said she would support me through it all, I really had hope for that relationship, unfortunately, it didn't. We broke up because she thought I was too clingy and I felt like I was smothering her with affection.

A year went by with me not being in any romantic relationships and all was fine until I met the most wonder girl a month ago. 

I believe that you shouldn't search for love, because if you do, it's all rushed and not true within and I met this girl unexpectedly, so I guess love found me.

Recently I noticed that my episodes started to spike again, and I'm so scared that I'm gonna fuck everything up between me and this girl. I know I shouldn't put all my happiness into one person but I can't fucking help it, she really deserves the moon and stars and Ill try my best to give her the best and even more.

She knows that I am bipolar and she understands that I sometimes have episodes where I may be sad or overthink that I might lose her because even though I know she really likes me too, there is always this voice in the back of my head telling me I'm gonna lose her because I'm smothering her with attention and I don't want to take any meds again because it really messes up my mood overall.

What should I do? I don't want to lose myself into loving someone else and I surely don't want to lose her."

2049,bipolar,On the Effects of Smoked Cannabis on Type II Bipolar Disorder,"This document discusses the subjective effects that smoking cured cannabis flowers have on bipolar disorder for a single subject; specifically myself. I suffer from Bipolar II disorder and PTSD, which likely resulted from a fairly standard collection of the environmental and genetic factors that tend to cause those. Included are some descriptions of what Bipolar II “feels” like, when closely scrutinised by somebody who turns his hypomanic episodes into frantic Wikipedia marathons.

Having observed how various factors relating to my inconsistent mental health state seem to change over time and in response to various external factors, I’ve developed a sense for how it “works” that appears to be somewhat predictive and helps me to rationalise the experience, ultimately resulting in more desirable behaviour.

**“Bipolar Level”; oh god please help me think of a better term**

While I originally understood my bipolar to be essentially caused by rising and falling affect, which resulted in a hypomanic episode when it rose above a certain threshold, and a depressive episode when it fell beneath another threshold, I’ve since developed the sense that there is some kind of bipolar force which rises and falls, dragging affect and several other attributes with it. I will refer to this force as the Bipolar Level, because I don’t think I could get away with calling it the Force and I don’t have a better term. If there’s already a medical term for what I’m talking about somebody please tell me as soon as possible. I would like to know more about the thing I am attempting to describe, and suspect physical evidence explaining it could be observed. Subjectively it might be described as “How much my head is fizzing.” Very high Bipolar Level produces a sort of thrumming quality in my thoughts, while a very low Bipolar Level feels very dull and flat, as if my mind would be unable to produce an echo. Thoughts feel week and attenuated, and it can be difficult to produce a thought with sufficient strength to actually result in speech or action.

When the Bipolar Level is between the two thresholds, it can be difficult to impossible to know anything about its position, as the difference between its effects and normal day-to-day and week-to-week fluctuations of mood in response to normal - or abnormal - events is unclear and essentially impossible to discern. You can think you might be a little bit depressed, but you’re not sure. You can wonder if your good mood is caused by doing well at the time, or the mutant throbbing of your rogue brain.


https://i.imgur.com/WP3Ocra.png

    The Bipolar Level should ideally be between the thresholds most or all of the time, but when it is, very little can be known or felt about its position in the band.

**Hypomanic Episodes - Smooth and Crash Landings**

The Bipolar Level appears directly tied to speed-of-thought, mental intensity, depth of passion, memory and other attributes, including the messy riddle of factors controlling ability to sleep. The higher the Bipolar Level, the less friction there is between thoughts becoming actions. When the Bipolar Level is above the Hypomanic Threshold, speed-of-thought and related attributes are so high that existence is somewhat exhausting, but initially the experience is so generally satisfying that the discomfort is obscured. Since sleep habits are badly affected, often resulting in highly inconsistent sleep and far less sleep overall, a dangerously mentally and physically exhausted state is more likely to occur the longer the episode lasts. 

A sufficiently exhausted state can result in an extremely sharp drop in the Bipolar Level, beneath the Depressive Threshold. Since this severely diminishes the success rate of encoding memories, I have a lot less to say about this state, but I know I get a lot more sleep when I’m depressed. 

Sometimes the Bipolar Level can gradually fall beneath the Hypomanic Threshold smoothly, allowing rest, and eventually eliminating the exhaustion. This is usually less common than the exhaustion causing undesirable outcomes.

https://i.imgur.com/dL4p7d1.png

    Hypomania can effectively cause a depressive episode through severe mental exhaustion.

**Decoupling of Affect from BL and Mixed Episodes**

The reason the Bipolar Level must be distinguished from affect is that they can be decoupled. If the Bipolar Level rises but affect is significantly lower, a mixed episode can result, which can marry the intensity of a hypomanic episode to the misery of a depressive one. Factors relating to this decoupling effect remain largely obscure to me, although traumatic life experiences appear able to cause it to occur. 

Chronic unsatisfactory conditions (such as those caused by poverty, unsafe living conditions, work stress, or lack-of-work stress) more consistently result in a coupled downward trend of both Bipolar Level and Affect until the Depressive Threshold is crossed. 

The Bipolar Level can also drift beneath the Depressive Threshold without necessarily taking Affect with it, resulting in a low functioning state, typified by lower activity, slower reaction time, reduced word availability, weight gain and generally lower discipline (or at least greater difficulty maintaining disciplined habits), without necessarily being accompanied by the typical anguish of a depressive episode. These phases are not very common, are typically short lived, and can precede either a full-blown depressive episode or a return to normal functionality.

I am of the poorly-supported opinion that many other psychological attributes which are normally “dragged” by the force described by the Bipolar Level can also be decoupled, resulting in the range of ways manic, depressive and mixed episodes can be experienced and presented. Internally, I am only able to discern clear discrepancies between affect and the Bipolar Level with any degree of familiarity, as compared to these vague other attributes, so that’s what I’ll be writing about when I refer to “decoupling.”

    BL drags Affect. The two tend to converge but track imperfectly.

    Two different scenarios that can decouple Affect from Bipolar Level


While a high decoupled affect appears to do little to raise the Bipolar Level, a low decoupled affect does drag the Bipolar Level steadily down with it, eventually resulting in a feedback loop; depression makes you depressed.

**Effect of Daily Cannabis on Bipolar Level**

Daily cannabis use appears to exert consistent downward force on the Bipolar Level. Even very light daily use appears to exert enough force to cause the Bipolar Level to trend downwards, largely irrespective of whatever other mysterious or apparent factors are affecting it at the time. However, the force which generally chiefly seems to control the Bipolar Level appears to exert a compensating upward force attempting to - but insufficient to - correct it. The line will trend downwards, and if usage continues unabated the Depressive Threshold will eventually be crossed and a depressive episode will result.

https://i.imgur.com/MXOMdMR.png

    Cannabis use can push the Bipolar Level beneath both thresholds if use is sustained.

Thus, cannabis can be used to lower the Bipolar Level beneath the Hypomanic Threshold, resulting in restedness, comfort and relatively healthy sleep. Cannabis-assisted sleep doesn’t appear to be as effective for the same duration as the few nights of solid healthy sleep I’ve had in my life, but is vastly preferable to unchecked disordered sleeping which makes participation in society essentially impossible.


**Effects of Cessation of Cannabis Consumption**

When cannabis consumption is suddenly ceased, the downward pressure it was exerting abates fairly sharply, so the compensating upward pressure almost immediately pushes the Bipolar Level above the Hypomanic Threshold. This is extremely likely to cause a decoupling of the Bipolar Level from affect. This means experiencing racing thoughts combined with agitation due to cannabis addiction, which inevitably results in me from daily use. While the structure of this result remains consistent, the degree of agitation experienced can vary wildly. At its worst, it can result in undesirable behaviours such as drug-seeking (including attempting to compensate with alcohol, in spite of having concluded that its drawbacks outweigh its benefits) and inferior social interaction (i.e. being an arsehole), but at its weakest it is easily dismissed; hypomania produces a bonus of willpower. Affect may rise and attempt to meet the Bipolar Level, lagging behind but eventually more or less catching up. This isn’t clear to me yet. Sometimes it appears to have done so, but I haven’t been sufficiently mindful of the phenomenon to have confidence.

Cessation has been vastly easier to control since I started rationalising my use this way.

https://i.imgur.com/XmE1h7n.png

    Cessation of cannabis use results in a sharp jump in Bipolar Level, often leaving Affect decoupled.

The effects of cessation of use during a depressive episode are likely to be a lot less predictable and potentially harmful. The effects of depression on memory prevent me from speaking about this with much clarity, but I would generally deem it to be extremely harmful. The effects of continuing cannabis use while depressed are also harmful. The entire scenario is to be avoided at all costs and no deliberate attempt will be made to clarify these matters.

**Bipolar Momentum**

The Bipolar Level appears to have momentum, with forces limiting its normal maximum rate of change. Thus, the downward force exerted by cannabis consumption is unable to cause it to drop from above the Hypomanic Threshold to beneath the Depressive Threshold unless consumption of cannabis is continued beyond a certain duration. This duration is likely to be variable, as the Bipolar Level is still being affected by countless other essentially unknowable factors. However, a safe minimum time shorter than required to push the Bipolar Level from the high line to the low line can probably be ascertained over time with some degree of certainty. So far, eight weeks of continuous consumption have proved insufficient to result in an observable depressive episode, but several subjective effects and indicators suggested that one was likely to occur. Cessation at this point had the same result as from shorter consumption periods.

The results of severe exhaustion, and of sudden cessation of cannabis consumption, are each noteworthy for their apparent violation of the tendency of the Bipolar Level to manifest momentum. Other such violations almost certainly exist and should be studied.


https://i.imgur.com/KOK4qe9.png

    Continuous cannabis use for more than eight weeks appears necessary to force the Bipolar Level from above the Hypomanic Threshold to beneath the Depressive Threshold. The amount of time likely varies.

**Self-treatment Plan and Conclusion**

My main goals in treating my bipolar disorder are to minimise the depth of - and amount of time spent in - depressive episodes, and eliminate undesirable behaviours resulting from hypomanic episodes (i.e. being an arsehole), as well as control damage caused by lack of sleep. Thus, it is acceptable to me to be hypomanic for two weeks at a time so long as I’m demonstrating adequate functionality. Naturally, external opinions are required to assess the true effects of my current state (i.e. I have to ask people who I trust if I’m being an arsehole).

My current self-treatment plan includes smoking around 15 grams of cured cannabis flowers over four weeks, then ceasing for two weeks. Depending on how I feel, the consumption period can be pushed to eight weeks. Cannabis-fasting periods longer than two weeks aren’t being considered, as exhaustion and poor sleep are consistently difficult to bear by that point. In this way, I expect to be able to control my Bipolar Level, ensuring that it is always slightly above or not too far beneath the Hypomanic Threshold. Strict cessation is ensured by deliberately preventing availability of cannabis. Relevant others are informed of the intended course of action to aid with strict adherence.


I intend to investigate the efficacy of various cannabis extract oils. Initial investigations proved not particularly promising, and the products may prove unaffordable for regular use. The product sampled yielded dramatically inferior relief from racing thoughts and exhaustion when compared to smoked buds, which were tried 24 hours after the insufficiently efficacious oil extract. Sleep occurred but quality and continuity were poor. I may also investigate their potential for easing into cannabis-fasting periods with less discomfort.

Three different prescription medications have been attempted for management of my mental health. None appeared to give any feedback, leading to anxious uncertainty about the position of the Bipolar Level, ultimately causing agitation, which was exacerbated when the medications proved inadequate to prevent depressive episodes. No hypomanic episodes were experienced under the effects of prescription medications. While nuanced conclusions about their effects can’t be made with such paucity of data as I’ve collected, I’m not experimenting on myself with those kinds of drugs any more. The take-away lesson was that they didn’t work.

Cannabis allows me to know roughly where my Bipolar Level is, because it is where I have put it.

In case anybody is getting a bit excitable, I don’t want anyone acting like I’ve cracked the code just because others share the same experience. I know a lot of people with bipolar are self-medicating with cannabis, but my terrible gibberish using big words is not so much nailing the problem down as suggesting a new line of inquiry, in the hope that the shared knowledge of people who read harder books than I do can shed some more light on the matter, and eventually produce far superior treatment plans tailored to each sufferer. Certainly superior to what this old stoner whipped up in his spare time. This isn’t a journal article. There are no references cited. I didn’t record hard data. There’s no need to pretend this document is something it isn’t. I’m hoping someone will write the good version of this in response, eventually.

I know a lot of people are completely against people with bipolar disorder or any mental health problem consuming cannabis at all. I consider them to have committed the Fundamental Attribution Error; they don’t know what it feels like inside our heads. I had a terrible time with prescription drugs, used according to directions in combination with the entire laundry list of things you’re meant to do to prevent depression, to no avail. Until this treatment plan I’ve been using some variation of all year fails to produce the results predicted in this document, I will continue to believe that careful use of cannabis produces results so far superior to those produced by prescription drugs that I won’t be reconsidering them until evidence emerges that they’ve actually found something good.

I also most sincerely don’t want to discount the experiences of people with some form of bipolar disorder for whom cannabis has proved to be an absolutely terrible idea. Our disorders are vague groups of symptoms and we’re really not terribly good at studying them. My thing might be totally different to your thing, and I am not pretending to any authority over anyone’s thing but my own. Though I’m going to feel extremely stupid if nobody else gets what I’m talking about. I’m also not encouraging people who have steered clear of cannabis and are successfully managing their illnesses to try this as an alternative without excellent cause. I think the negative impact cannabis has in society is usually exaggerated and always misunderstood, but it is not entirely made up.

I think that so long as a sufficiently rigorous cessation protocol is employed, the biggest drawbacks are the expense, illicit nature of the substance, which leads to complications and potentially anxiety, and the fact that I’m destructively distilling plant matter directly into my lungs, which you shouldn’t need a science teacher to tell you isn’t the brightest idea. Oral administration only yields a fraction of the therapeutic results, so far, but an acceptable alternative to smoking plant matter has to be found.

At the time of writing this, I am experiencing a hypomanic episode, but it is scheduled to end *almost immediately*."
2050,bipolar,How have Lamotrigine + Adderall worked for you?,"29M, I've been on 200mg lamotrigine 2/day for almost 3 years now. Recently, I decided to seek treatment for my ADHD symptoms because I saw someone whose cocktail is lamotrigine and adderall, and my most recent ex and I talked about the necessity of medication for both bp and adhd (she has adhd). 

So, I'm wondering how the adderall/lamotrigine (venlafaxine and wellbutrin are non-starters) cocktails has worked for others.

2052,bipolar,My Misdiagnosis Almost Killed Me,"tl;dr: Always stand up for yourself when you know your medication is not right. I didn't, and I almost died.

&amp;#x200B;

In July, I received a new diagnosis from my second psychiatrist. It turned out I was on the bipolar spectrum, but I was so barely on it that no one noticed. My depressive symptoms were so aggressive, and my hypomania (if you could even call it that) just looked like I was very productive.

The only way we know for sure is because the new medication I was put on started giving me damaging hypomania symptoms. I told my psychiatrist I randomly was able to stay up for days at a time, and we knew.

My first psychiatrist didn't catch it. In fact, he dismissed it. My therapist at the time almost caught it. After I told her that some days I only need 3 hours of sleep but other days I felt like I needed 12, she suspected I could be bipolar. However, she admitted that she didn't feel qualified to diagnose something like that and told me to bring it up with my psychiatrist. I brought it up with him, and he almost immediately shrugged it off.

For months, I was being treated with medications that could have never helped me. (I don't know why some medications can treat depression but not bipolar's depressive symptoms. It's so weird.) The meds I was on were either doing nothing or making me worse.

My first psychiatrist told me I had severe depression and treatments began. First, I was on Lexapro. I told my psychiatrist that I didn't feel any better, if not worse. Then it was Prozac. Still nothing. Still a possible worse.

Next was Lamictal. Lamictal is a mood stabilizer.

I think he was a bit frustrated that none of the more traditional SSRIs were helping me, so he decided to go down an alternative route. He told me that Lamictal, though a mood stabilizer, was known to help depression.

Looking back, now knowing I'm on the bipolar spectrum, I wonder what damage it was doing to me. I was already so depressed, and I have to assume taking only a mood stabilizer dragged me even further down.

I'd never felt so low. Suicidal thoughts were banging their fists in my head. I felt sadness manifest itself as physical pain.

I told my psychiatrist that I felt horrible.

He told me I was still adjusting.

He doubled my dosage.

I don't know why he did it. Maybe he really thought sticking through with it would help me. Maybe because I'm young and girl he didn't take me seriously. Maybe he was irritated that I was switching so much. I don't know.

A week later I tried to kill myself. I took myself to the ER before I could take enough pills.

I spent a few months after that scared to go back and try a new psychiatrist with meds.

But I did it. I'm here now.

I want to share my story because I never want this to happen to anyone else. When he told me he was doubling my dosage, I should've started screaming and crying and doing whatever it took to make him listen to me. I should've just not taken the pills. I should've found a new psychiatrist the moment he didn't listen to me.

But I didn't want to cause a scene. But I *wanted* to be ""still adjusting"" and for these pills to be the one to work. But I was so worn out I don't think I had the energy to find a new one.

Still, no matter how many arguments I had against it, I wish someone had told me how important it is to stand up for yourself. To even medical professionals when you know they're wrong.

So, this is me. Telling you."
2053,bipolar,I almost called out of work today because I felt that bad.,"If it was bad today, I don't want to imagine how tomorrow is going to be.

I think I'm headed to a mixed episode. I have gotten a comment on how I seem to be ""the fun kind of tired"" recently, but on the inside I feel horrible.

I don't know what to do. I feel powerless, and I really hope that the new medications work soon."
2054,bipolar,Could this be related to bipolar (hypersexual),"Hi all!

So a short question but could bouts of hypersexual be related to bipolar? I was diagnosed but I don't really agree with the diagnosis though I've been getting these bouts every few months and usually after a depression.

So if I can describe it, it feels like I'm in heat. If I don't do anything it kind of calms down but if I'm in a relationship or doing anything it gets way way worse. Like I'm in the early phases of a romantic relationship that isn't official and this time I'm feeling my emotions too? Like my emotions and my sex drive is absolutely wild.

So could this be a kind of subdued instance of hypomania? I do feel a bit buzzy but other than the wild sex drive, there's nothing."
2055,bipolar,I’m healing?,"It gets better I promise.

2056,bipolar,Can remission last a lifetime?,"Hi all,

I (27M) suffer from bipolar disorder with psychosis and I currently take lithium and risperidone. I've been in total remission for almost a year and have been in remission previously for around four years. Between episodes I have normal cognitive functioning and no real disturbances. Is it possible that I will be in remission for the rest of my life if I continue to take my meds?

My cousin (57M; actually the step-brother to my natural cousin) also has bipolar disorder (no psychosis) and he hasn't taken meds in years. He's been in remission for over five years I think, no meds and no symptoms. He likes to exercise and has a great support network in his loving wife. Could his remission last for the rest of his life?

Will there come a day where I can finally be free of meds? I like to think it's possible. My therapist has pushed me to consider tapering off (with the help of my doctor I assume, though it's worth sharing that my therapist is skeptical that I even have bipolar disorder since I'm so stable). How often does this sort of thing happen?"
2057,bipolar,"Anyone been on Paliperidone before? (Devastating long-lasting effects, rant)","So I was hospilized for 3 months in Darwin hospital last year around the start of may and it was quite a severer breakdown of a pretty bad psychosis that I couldn't stop in its tracks. They gave me my first treament of ECT 5 times to remove the mania or psychosis which initially worked. They however left me go a little early at one point because I fooled them I was okay, (in which I wasn't) I just wanted to badly get out of there because for males in Darwin hospital you have to share a room with 2 other patients in the smallest rooms, I could barely sleep as they took me off seroquel.

Anyways, when I evenually came back into hospital after only a 3 days they monitored me and eventually started giving me 'Paliperdone'. At the time I didn't notice, and always trusted the doctors, but when I look back it completely took away the mania and put me into a numb depressive state. I was managable for awhile, but once they increased the dose to 150, I started to experience really bad effects.

My whole body started feeling weird sensations, all through my legs, arms and body it was a weird tingling feeling. Then I started to develop really bad anxiety and then started to develop akathisia, from now which I now know. At the time, the doctors couldn't explain any of these weird side effects and barely didn't know what to do. It's only months later that I found out what 'akathisia' bloody was, and is a main side effect of the PALIPERIDONE!.. From this, my sex drive has been completely comprised as he also gave me Zoloft to help deal with the akathisia which was another error which just made things worse.

So after months of pain and suffering, the akathisia finally went away.. but I still can't fully relax like I once did. The only persistent problem is this unexplainable sensations throughout my lower legs. It's a constant pins and needles like feeling, and I get it a lot when I am obviously sitting down. When I am standing up right, it takes ages to go away and ends up feeling numb.

Every time I go to bed, it feels like a dull ache or numb type feeling hard to describe. But I assure you, it's gotta be this drug messing around with the dopamine in my brain. It's been nearly a year now, and I lack absolute pleasure in anything like I did before. Mate these drugs cause more problems than they solve, and the patient is the one left to suffer at the hands of a doctors note pad.

Has anyone else had this experience with this drug? Throughout my mental health career I've always had other drugs like Seroquel and now I know why they prescribe that all the time because that's probably the only antipsychotic that doesn't cause these awful long lasting side effects. I just can't believe it's been a year, and 2020 for all of us have been so shit, pretty over it."

I once made a post about mixing lamictal and marijuana and got so many responses but a lot of them said they do it all the time and it’s perfectly fine. I really feel like taking a small baby dose of adderall. Starting dosage is 5mg I’d probably break it in half and do 2.5mg. I also didn’t like THC because it made me paranoid and triggered hypomania and paranoid and hallucinations (which are already present without drugs) and it enhances it a little. But now I’m in a mood stabilizer so I’m not sure what will happen. 

Obviously I can’t tell my psychiatrist “I want Adderall because I haven’t been focusing at all and am a full time college student and work and I’ve been so out of it and can’t focus on anything and I’d only take Adderall when I REALLY need it and not often. No more than two a month or something”. Knowing me, I will not get addicted. And I know everyone thinks that at first and end up getting addicted but I’ve been prescribed Xanax and don’t abuse it at all and my psychiatrist watches or keeps an eye on me. He’ll give me like 10 pills and if I finish them too quickly, he won’t prescribe more if he thinks I’m at risk. But he trusts me fully. 
But he won’t prescribe it anyways because it’s for the wrong reason and I don’t have ADHD. I wouldn’t get it off the streets I don’t trust anyone. Maybe someone else with the prescription. 

But has anyone else tried it? Does it trigger hypomania? Do you crash or get depressed worse than normally when it starts wearing off? Please help."

I am also struggling with reconnecting with everyone, talking them through why I wasn’t able to work the last month etc. I am transparent about why I disappeared from work and yet every single person is telling me how I’ve lost weight like it’s a great thing (I wasn’t chubby before either). 

I usually just say something like this is not my ideal weight and I am struggling to eat and sleep properly hoping it would make them uncomfortable enough to stop pursuing the conversation.

January 17, 2018 
0353 CST

It tears me apart when I'm in the midst of an agitated episode and I can suddenly see in her expression how terrifying and upsetting I am to behold. I'm all beady eyed, sweaty, been in the garage for 16 hours creating some ""masterpiece"" I'll never finish. She'll coyly knock, peek her beautiful face through the door, and I'll get all irritated. I'll be short because she's ""interrupting"" my ""creative process"" or whatever crude, aggresive explanation or response i need to utter to rid her from my space. She's trying to love you, why won't you let her?

I'm so in the zone, I can't even bother listening to my spouse for fifteen seconds (FIFTEEN SECONDS) - i grind my teeth counting each one until I can return to whatever bullshit fixation I'm temporarily entertaining at the moment. I'm such a cold son of a bitch, the husband I swore I'd never be.

When i slide back down to stable, and all the euphoria, profound ambition and God-like focus is just another crusty coffee stain in my cortex - another grandiose, haphazardly executed idea...another distraction and an enormous mess to tend to after the manic dust settles...I withdraw, I hide, from her and from myself.

It's making sure to hide that overdraft letter from the bank (because man, that's emasculating). It's making sure to cover up my ribs coming out of the shower, I continue to lose weight, she might worry. The food here sucks (by here I mean everywhere).

If I had the choice, food would be a beige liquid in an IV bag or some sort of organic flash drive you can insert into your neck. Eating, hydration, hygiene - these things are just obstacles that interfere with achieving my ""vision"" (cough DELUSION cough).

""Everyone just wants to take take take"", I say to myself - so, I hoarde my time to myself, and defend it, because I don't know how much longer this incredible feeling will last, and when it will be back again. I dread to think what's at the bottom of the waterfall I am approaching. I may be be down there longer than I thought. I've been on this bipolar river analogy so long, it's all I know. At least the territory is familiar. I painfully accept my cyclical existence, it feels like home at this point. I somehow avoid drowning, again and again. I lean into my episodic contenders punch, embrace the suck. Muscle memory. My bread and butter. I can see the next episode. Hello, old friend. Alone in the garage again, I indulge my madness. 

For days, I'm a basically a transient roommate, trotting along with my hypomanic impulses arm in arm, digging the hole deeper together, as days pass, sleep withers to mere moments, until I eventually crash, and wake one morning to realize the Magic is gone.

I know it is gone when I wrap my hands around the neck of this guitar, this fishing pole, blast that one song, or pick up my camera - a cold apathy seeps through my veins, the thought of needing to use the slightest bit of effort is anesthetizing, I stay locked to the mattress, away from my bullshit hobbies, which are also downstairs (so far away from bed). Creative was something I used to be. Right now, I just need to make it through another day.

Anything vibrant now seems opaque and uninteresting, my ideas nonsensical, my writing unintelligible. What do I have to show for all my ""hard work"" (aka meth head tinkering and projects with no plan or obvious direction)?

Receipts. The tears in her eyes. The bags under mine. And that empty, sinking feeling that ive (yet again) burdened the only woman I've ever loved - this phrase will be the gas station pump TV soundbite echoing in my mind and will regularly bring me to tears when i drive to and from work, in the shower, that 150ft walk to the mailbox, in between the busy static of everyday life, those quiet personal moments of total stillness that are instantly over the moment you realize you're having one. The bipolar mind is never still, some overwhelming emotion will soon fill the void. I am trapped inside my own mind. I rub her tears between my fingers, ""who have you become?""

I should shut my eyes, try one more time. Too cold to work again. Savings running low. Might try using the SAD Light, I cry too much at work. The light reminds me of high school, when I vomited seroquel and oatmeal all over it, drove to school and slept in the parking lot until lunch (because seroquel). I wish I could sleep like that again.

3119,bipolar,Medications Causing Cognitive Impairments and no Options,"I've read through studies, learnt at University, read through literature and I'm sad that psychiatric medications will contribute to cognitive impairments. It makes me want to stop meds and reluctant to take them. 

I know you will be saying but bipolar could be giving cognitive impairments as well. Before meds my cognition was fine until I was put on meds then I realised a significant dramatic drop in my cognition. 

I don't know how I'm going to live life and reading this makes me really sad."
3120,bipolar,"I'm struggling (CW: physical + emotional abuse, drugs, discussion of suicide)","(TL;DR, childhood physical abuse, attempts to feel love, further trauma, drinking to forget it all, now what) 

Sorry for the long post. But if you skim it and see anything here that resonates, I'd love to hear about your own experiences.

I'll make this blunt and not prosodic at all. I am about to enter my 4th year of university. When I was 18 I was diagnosed as bipolar 2 after some episodes of obvious hypomania and debilitating depression.

When I entered university a lot of my anxieties were seemingly abated because I was able to leave my abusive household. I was thus very responsive to whoever showed me love and better yet whoever made the first move, so I could fall into whatever they wanted me to be for a year. I did this. Twice in a row. Both ended terribly because I, now being ""stable,"" was doing just fine not having an inkling of what it means to love someone, but to be that for someone else. I was just happy to feel accepted at all. The second relationship ended with her using suicide threats to get me to come back to her place after I had repeatedly tried to leave. (but she would always find a way to guilt me into coming back...) While hiding at my friend's place, he had to physically restrain me so that I wouldn't be coerced into returning to her. I had no idea how manipulated I was. This experience left me emotionally wounded. I thought I was going to be responsible for someone's death that night—my legacy on this earth. I was pretty much ready to die too, something I would never say to anyone. But she, on the other hand, seemed to be fine. We broke up.

That was the beginning of 2020. At that point, I had been off my meds for a year, and also had kicked all the drug habits I picked up while in the relationship (which wasn't hard, because I was only taking coke because she was taking it) Things were going great. Objectively great, not manic great—to the point where I began to doubt I was bipolar. To actually feel some semblance of independence was a huge breath of fresh air, and also incredibly daunting because beyond my two friends on campus I don't really have any proper friends because I'm pretty reluctant to get close to anyone. I spent the beginning of this year being pretty lazy and just enjoying having my own space.

Fast forward a couple months. That same ex hits me up and says she is addicted to meth and wants help kicking it. I come over (what's the worst that could happen) and she offers that I try and then we get stupidly high on meth and ghb. One night turns into two weeks. 

Yeah. I fucking hate myself for this. 

I definitely have a problem with impulsivity. And the shame and compensation that follows it. But those were turned against me once again before I could even process them. The times I went back home she would always ""need"" me to return immediately to ""help"" her even though I told her I was clearly utterly incapable of doing that. Wtf did I think was going to happen, right? 

""Maybe it will be good this time?""

Anyways. This situation once again exploded, she showed up to my dorm in a stimulant psychosis multiple times, threatened to contact my family, ruin my life, kill herself if I didn't come get high with her ""one last time,"" etc. I had never felt so unsafe in my life. That week I was on such high alert and in panic mode that I never had time to even process my emotions because hers were so erratic and now effectively my problem. I didn't sleep for DAYS—that is, until I took up drinking. And for once, I had a drug (seemingly) solve all of my problems. I loved it. 

For the first time, I felt like I had control over my life. Free from my pain, my mistakes, myself. I have been more or less consistently drunk since then. That was mid-May. 

And here I am. I feel as if I am slowly forgetting how to be a person and I have no idea who that person even was. The increased sociability from alcohol was definitely a lie because I'm still a nervous wreck and struggle to trust people. Most people in my life just want to fuck which is whatever, but I keep attracting those who don't respect my boundaries. Especially when what I crave is just love and mutual trust. But it ain't happening.

The two friends I still love dearly seem to be slowly drifting away because my tendency to drink all the time turns me into a recluse; and when we're together I'm usually drunk OR super anxious and they are getting sick of my shit. I feel like the sensitive empathetic person I am and strive to be just isn't fully there. I'm reluctant to say it but I have lots of fantasies of just dying. I would never purposely hurt myself but this drive to disappear is really strong.

I fear that I'm becoming more cynical, mistrustful of others, and ultimately too lonely for my own good. I'm thinking about going back on meds but I feel like I really need to kick this alcohol habit first. This last glass of wine is the only thing I'm really looking forward to right now."
3121,bipolar,Just very sad,"When I'm feeling more upbeat I am the type of person that loves to give. I love to give my time and energy to people because I have so much excess (when I don't, I can end up hurting myself or spiralling) but then, when I feel down, people still just expect me to be that person and in those moments I realise how little people actually care. 

I call some of these people my friends but they have no problem calling me and just ranting for hours without even asking how I am doing. I am not very open about my struggles but still, as people we should at least try to be attuned to each others emotions. 

I know it's kind of my fault for being the type of person that tries to be approachable and non-judgemental but I just see so much sadness and evil in the world that if I can make someone's day even a little bit better, even if it's just by listening to them, then it brings me joy to do so. 

But then, I can't always be like that, I crash sometimes. Sometimes I can't leave my bedroom, let alone my house, sometimes I turn my phone off for days on end and people only seem to care that they couldn't reach me for a rant. Or they don't care at all. 

I'm not saying everyone in my life is like that, I know some brilliant people who are compassionate towards me, it is a minority of people but I am so insanely grateful for them. 

But yeah, I'm currently sitting here crying and writing this because I just feel sad and there's no one for me to talk to at this moment. 

I hope everyone is doing well &amp; taking care of themselves 💙"

She doesn't know where he went.

This is the second time he broke my heart in the past 6 months, I was ecstatic when he asked for me back. I don’t know how much longer I can deal. If I don’t end up with him in the future.. it’s not worth it. I’d rather just die right now. I am fantasizing about my razor blades when I haven’t self harmed in 16 months.

I’m spitting up dirt from my sleep, waking into silent mornings spent staring at nothing and wondering why I can’t cry. I’ve been listening to my coworker talk about her deceased step daughter and I get annoyed? Then I’m hit with the horror that I am jealous. I want to be dead. Why am I like this?

I’m tired of having adhd as well. Honestly the adhd sucks more than the bipolar. I hate being depressed I look at all my neurotypical friends And I’m just jealous. It’s unfair why me? Like why do I have to to feel this way. I understand that it’s going to get easier but I’m always going to have this. I’m depressed all the time do your meds make you depressed. I can’t concentrate I can’t do school. I don’t want to do anything I can’t even watch tv. I just graduated high school and all of my plans are over because of Covid. I lost all my friends and I can’t go to college and make new friends. I’m talking to my ex girlfriend and we might date again we talked about getting married what am I talking about? What am I doing? It’s a huge source of stress in my life to talk to my ex because in a manic episode I said some pretty “abusive” things that I didn’t mean and she went around and told people that I abused. And now everybody thinks that I abused her. I don’t know what I did but she said she’s forgiven but I don’t know she let everybody hate me. I mean I should have a right to be mad. I mean maybe not. But she told I physically assaulted her?!? I don’t know I don’t think I did that. I loved her I wouldn’t hurt her. And I lost my best friend she blocked everything randomly because my ex told her that I abused her. I literally lost all of my friends because of my ex and now we’re going to start dating again? I love her what am I supposed to do? And her mom hates me as well. Her moms crazy she goes through her phone and gaslits her and treats her daughter like she’s her coworker friend and therapist basically. It’s just a crappy situation. So I don’t know. I might post more on this subreddit. Sorry I don’t know much about reddit I just want some support.
4207,bipolar,Sometimes I think I am dead...?,"just looking for anyone who can relate because i dont know anyone who gets this. probably cuz i never told anybody. figured this was anonymous enough yet i still feel uncomfortable typing it out and will probably delete later.

so theres this thing that happened a few times in my life. the first time was in highschool. maybe around 15 or 16.

i suddenly felt like...i didnt exist? or i was dead? i would feel like im not human or like i was just a body on autopilot going through motions. a few times i just felt like i was a soul in someone's body. i would stare at myself in the mirror and felt like it wasnt me. and like when i was standing i would look at my feet and sometimes it looked like the ground was closer like i was a couple feet shorter. then other times i felt way taller than i am, like the ground was further away than usual. i thought maybe my life was a dream or existence itself didnt exist. or i was living someones memories and the real me was off somewhere else in another body with another family. it went away for a while but the feeling of me not being a real actual human was still there. i tried to kill myself at 16 and saw a doctor and he diagnosed me with bipolar and anxiety, then schizoaffective, then back to bipolar. 

then around age 19 or 20 it kinda came back but was slightly different. still had the feeling like i wasn't really alive or didnt exist and i would sometimes...stand outside my body? i guess thats how i would describe it. the most memorable time was when i was hanging out with my friends (or this body that was dead was chatting with friends and going through motions) and i was just watching for a few minutes. like, i wasnt moving a muscle or speaking but the body i was observing from the side a few feet away was talking and moving but it wasnt me controlling it. i started to think about whether anything in general existed. i felt like one day i would try to talk to my family and they wouldnt look at me or respond and i would just not be there. like i died a long time ago or never existed in the first place. it went away again after a few months or so. timelines are hard to place.

im now 24 and the feeling is coming back. i feel dead but when i feel my pulse on my neck its still there. but i feel like maybe im dead and decomposing but at a wayyyyy slower pace than normal body decomposition. my muscles feel stiff. i was diagnosed with scoliosis and early degenerative joint disease a few months back too. i feel like maybe my body is very slowly going into rigor mortis and i feel heavy and like my body will just move slower and stop moving or move very little. and like then the muscles will feel softer and moveable after that like when rigor mortis ends and muscles start liquefying and putrefy. and then my heart will actually stop.

but when this happens and goes away i feel alive again and logically i know im alive but i just also think im dead and slowly decomposing. and its confusing cuz when i come out of it i feel like a living being. so i just feel weird about it. idk why i feel like this.

when it happened the second time around age 19 or 20 i got heavily into drinking and when my sister saw me drunk all i could say was ""i dont want to feel like myself"" over and over. nothing else came out of my mouth but that."

4222,bipolar,Manic epiphany?,"Hey y’all, coming down from an episode and am looking to get some perspective from folks who hopefully understand. 

It was triggered by hearing a neighbor, which I was convinced was a negative conversation about me. It began very simply and occasionally, but continued to escalate over the course of a few weeks to hearing extremely specific personal topics, being directly spoken to, hearing conversations while not at home to the point I assumed we must have a psychic connection or something, and the fear that I was going to be exposed as a fraudulent piece of shit. It was so real and intersected with a lot of my deepest insecurities (fear of being a burden or unintentionally hurtful, shame over my past mistakes, the idea that my mental health issues are an excuse for my own failure, etc). At first, my partner believed me, but as it became more elaborate, my partner realized that it wasn’t real (he can’t hear it) or at the very least couldn’t possibly be about me, because I’m fairly quiet and more or less keep to myself. I refused to accept this, letting it consume me to the point I could barely walk around without the anxiety of being unwanted in my neighborhood (yes, jumped from neighbor to whole neighborhood) overwhelming me into panic attacks. Stayed with friends for a few days, then my partner and I went out of town to try to decompress, which is when I realized that these were delusions. It was like radio interference to my brain cleared, or a fog lifted. I’m feeling better, but am now ashamed, feel stupid and depressed. I see a psychiatrist who I really like, but I don’t know how to explain this to her in our quick remote appointments. I feel like I’ve been lying to her. Depersonalization/derealization are pretty consistent states for me and always have been since childhood, it’s definitely my dysfunctional coping mechanism. I’m also fearful of starting all over again with medication.

Background: I was diagnosed with depression, adhd, and social anxiety after having a breakdown that resulted in me flunking out of college. I’ve taken Zoloft and Wellbutrin for a few years now without much of a difference. As I’ve gotten older and am able to recognize the patterns of my behavior (instead of attributing it to being an eternal fuck up), I realize that this has been cyclical and I’m definitely somewhere on the bipolar spectrum (and OCD, but one thing at a time). I KNOW I need to talk to someone, but I’d prefer in person and the pandemic has obviously complicated things. Both of my parents have similar issues, undiagnosed.

TL;DR 27 y/o probably misdiagnosed and have realized I’m bipolar, but don’t know how to tell my psychiatrist without feeling like I’ve been dishonest. Looking for sense of crazy community and insight about my bullshit. Hayulp.

4226,bipolar,Antidepressants for treating anxiety and weight gain?,"Hey all, hope everyone is staying safe and wearing a mask.

I had a question about antidepressants that treat anxiety. A couple months ago my psychiatrist prescribed me atarax to treat my panic attacks. I had recurring panic attacks as a child and teen, but they seemed to mostly subside when i went on medication (lamictal and wellbutrin) until recently. She said to take one when I felt anxious and let her know if my symptoms change over time. If my symptoms get worse she said we might revisit the idea of adding another antidepressant to help with anxiety. My symptoms havent gotten worse exactly, but i'm having to treat my panic attacks way more often because i'm having more and more of them. I figure this is the time where i should reach out to her and let her know my anxiety is getting worse and revisit the antidepressant thing. I am open to adding another medication, but i've been looking into them and they all seem to cause weight gain. I've already gained a bit of weight recently which has affected my self image a lot. I'm not sure if i can handle more weight gain that is out of my own control.

Any advice? Is there a medication for anxiety that doesnt cause weight gain? Or a way to not gain weight on those medications? I'm not really able to exercise right now (besides the walking and lifting i do at work) because i dont have access to a gym and i dont live in a safe area where i could run"

5325,bipolar,I just feel like giving up.,"I'll keep this as short as I can. I hate my life and I just wanna give up and die in a corner. I'm taking meds but I don't take them like I'm supposed to on a daily basis.

I'm on probation for a domestic violence case. I'm not a violent person but when the police interviewed me I refused to talk to them because I didn't want to throw my wife under the bus. She certainly didn't have a problem doing it to me though. I'm looking at prison time now.

I've lost literally all my friends and my family doesn't even want anything to do with me because I manipulate them, use them, and treat them like shit when I'm manic. I'm an alcoholic piece of shit and I'm tired of it and I don't feel like there's any way out. I'm about to be evicted because I can't keep a job for more than a month.

I'm thinking about going to my mental hospital to keep me there at least I'll be safe. I don't want to die I just don't see a way out of this hell. Somebody please give me some uplifting advice. I need it or all hope is lost for me. I'm sorry my post is so long but I really needed to vent. Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this. Any positive feedback is greatly appreciated."
5326,bipolar,Feeling like I'm getting better and not,"Doing well some days, not dealing with psychosis or the worst of mania and not dealing with the worst of depression anymore but still some days all I want to do is just lie down on the floor from feeling so overwhelmed by how incredibly lonely I feel for no reason and this intense feeling of something being wrong or that I am constantly doing things wrong. I'm already doing so much better these days compared to even 3 years ago, but I'm left wondering if I'll feel this way and will have to deal with these feelings for the rest of my life."
5327,bipolar,I can't eat but I feel super hungry,"Anyone know how to fucking fix this it's been weeks of forcing myself to eat I hate it, I want to say fuck it and l remind myself how hunger feels after weeks of not eating but I'm in the midst of uni classes and I need the energy carbs and fats provide, I seriously can't think of a single thing that sounds appetizing for some reason anyone know any tricks to get the brain back to wanting to eat beside starvation?"
5329,bipolar,Feeling defeated and slightly useless,"I finally got myself to schedule  a therapy appointment. I feel like I just keep hitting walls. Since it’s all still virtual, she apparently emailed me the paperwork but I never received it so we had to reschedule. It was supposed to be this morning. I had 10:30am written down and typically my therapists have sent appointment reminders 1-3 days before but she didn’t. I woke up to sign in at 10:30 and I saw the appointment reminder set for 10am. I cross referenced the scheduling email and realized I did write the time wrong, and it was for 10am, so I missed it. I emailed her and called her but honestly I get if she doesn’t want to reschedule with me again. I tried to do something to help myself and ended up somehow self sabotaging it. Yeah, I don’t feel good."
5330,bipolar,am i faking it all?,"you know. it’s about 3am now and i’m kind of in my mentally ruminatory phase that my ocd puts me through every night and I’m thinking to myself again about the journey ive had with my bipolar disorder up until this point. when I experience mania or depression, to me, in my head, it feels like the end of the world. like everything is crumbling around me and I’ve lost control of it all. The universe is spinning and expanding and exploding all at once inside me and it becomes too much to handle. But then... the few times I’ve opened up to my mom about my mental health (which is essentially never, for many reasons), she tells me that she can’t tell, and that it’s all in my head. Of course, it’s all in my head, I mean, they’re mental illnesses... but she continues to tell me that all my life I’ve apparently been “searching” for some disorder to label myself with, and this is just another manifestation of that so-called desire I’ve apparently had since I was a child. And it makes me feel so incredibly invalid... I don’t even know how to explain it more. and I think it’s all my fault that (in my opinion) it seems as though every therapist I’ve visited takes my issues lightly. it feels to me like I am so ill and so barely able to function but the way my family treats me as if I’m neurotypical and how therapists treat me as if I just have basic anxiety issues that can be cured with being more “present” and “in the moment” (I am SO beyond sick of going through the same lecture from therapists that EATING SLOWLY will help me with all my issues) makes me feel even worse. I feel as though I’m being eaten up from the inside out. I just feel so incredibly bad about it all"
5331,bipolar,How to communicate with my girlfriend,My girlfriend recently had a baby and I know the hormones going crazy aren’t making anything better. Whenever she does get upset she just gets quiet and when I ask what’s wrong it’s the same answer every time. Nothing. But obviously the way she is physically acting something is off with her. We were just having full on conversations then something happened between us that could have been talked out in a minute and she completely just turns into this other person I don’t know. She doesn’t wanna talk and if I do get her to talk it’s very short with me. What do I do?
5332,bipolar,Need advice! therapy resistance and childhood trauma,"I am writing this in tears because my(25F) partner (28M) divulged to me that he doesn't want to go on with life. I know a lot of people have suicidal thoughts but would never go through with it but bipolar make that likelihood unpredictable. He is currently suffering with money issues, rejection, and the loss of his grandma. He doesn't have insurance or extra money to spend on ""affordable"" therapy and hes also resistant to therapy because he doesnt think they can help or anyone can relate to him. I started doing a guided CBT with him and made it feel like a conversation rather than me trying to get him to do therapy. He was receptive to it but doesn't want to talk about it anymore. He went through a lot of abuse as a child and often feels alone. I was sickened by some of the stuff his mother said to him as a child. for example she told him to just kill himself and stop talking about his emotions. HE WAS A CHILD! I'm just so heartbroken by all of this and I was wondering whats the best way to get him to go to therapy or talk to someone about this? Should I tell his aunt (who loves him like hes her own)?

If you were ever resistant to therapy what finally made you go? Do you know of any good online therapists or support groups other than this one? What do you find helpful while coping with depressive period?"
5333,bipolar,Never knowing when that low will hit hurts the most,"That epic moment when you'd rather stay up looking for something to give you serotonin but by no means do you have the energy to actually do any of the things you care about so instead you mindlessly click through YouTube videos and scroll through social media grasping onto those 5 seconds when you smile because just pretending like you want to be awake is so much less crushing than you know your thoughts will be when you lie down to go to sleep so you just stay up and ruin your entire schedule just so you don't have to face your emotions in a still silence because at this point you've developed a reliability on internet personalities just to pretend like you enjoy the days passing by and that you can ignore the persistent headaches that seem to suddenly appear when you're finally feeling something and only add to the annoyance of general every day life until every little sound is so annoying you inevitably have to sit in your own thoughts and pretend like you'll get to sleep eventually only to wake up and do it all again but with just a little more emptiness in your chest than the day before. 

It's so easy to forget this downfall will happen, and just as easy to forget the good times come around eventually. I'm at that point where distractions from myself are the only thing keeping me going and air feels like breathing in ice cold water where it just sits in my lungs. When silence means I have to hold back tears for what feels like no reason. When there's constantly a pressure in the back of my throat because I'm always ready to cry. When the physical weight of my body legitimately feels 2× more. When days without headaches only pass by on miracles. When I just really wish I wasn't like this sometimes. I think I could even deal with this all if I could just lie down in my head for 5 minutes without breaking down. I know I have to wake up and go to work but I'd much rather pretend this fatigue isn't washing over me so I don't have to deal with myself. Just let me sleep for once and I'll just deal with the rest, but I really can't just ruin my schedule on a whim because that will ruin everything. Why can't the silence just be bearable."
5335,bipolar,Have you had a manic episode on an antipsychotic?,I’m just wondering if this is something that happens
5336,bipolar,I lost everything tonight,"We weren't doing well for a lot of reasons, but the thing that drove her to leave me was my Bipolar. She told me I was too sick to handle. She said that I needed to get more help than I have. I did everything I possibly could've to be a good wife to her and now she's gone because of this monster of an illness. 

I worked myself to death in therapy, forced my way through vicious trauma harder and faster than my therapist had ever seen before, I stayed medicated for her even though it destroyed my art career and made me a shell of a human being. I spent all my time doing anything and everything for her and she still decided that my illness was too much and left me behind.

This illness drives everyone away eventually.

I feel like I'm nothing but a monster."

5340,bipolar,"New around, I have some questions.","Hi ! I'm 23 and officially got diagnosed with bp (2?) three months ago. I'd been treated for depression and generalized anxiety disorder for the past ten years. Got admitted to the hospital in February because of a serious depressive episode. I've been in a serious depressive low for a year now but have had multiple hypomanic episodes this year as well.

I started lithium a month ago and I heard it needed months to work. When and how did you notice the first changes ?

Switching from heavy antidepressants to a bipolar-fitted treatment, I've gone from extremely emotionally numb to oversensitive and I'm not sure how to process my emotions anymore, do you have any tips on that ?

I've entirely lost my sex drive since even before February, has it happened to anyone else, do you have advice on how to reconnect with your sex drive ? I don't mind the lack of desire but I feel bad for my partner.

I've been on sick leave for the past six months and I'm worried about never being able to fully function in a workplace. I'm thinking of switching to a part-time job (I'm a bookseller) but I'm still anxious about not being functional enough. Has being on meds helped you in managing your daily lives ? How do you cope with daily changes or issues ?

Rediscovering emotions has made me an irrationally angry person. I'm angry over the smallest things. I try to hide it but it's exhausting. Does the treatment help with that ? I don't know if it's part of who I am or the indicator of a mixed/hypomanic state.

I struggle with accepting I'm bipolar after having thought for ten years that I was depressive. It's hard to try and take into account that my manic phases aren't ""normal"" or just me ""being productive"" and I have a hard time recognizing the early signs of a manic state. I usually realize weeks later even when I've been a fool with my money or behaved rashly. How did you accept you were bipolar ?

Thanks for reading me !"
5341,bipolar,I hate everything. Good night. ♥,Your post body must contain text.
5342,bipolar,Everyone thinks you're cool and fun until you turn it in their direction.,"so many times people appreciate how calm and collected I can be (disassociation), how cool and badass and flippant I can be (hypo and the general 'fuck it' attitude often imbued in that), how dedicated I can be (hypo) and how 'resilient' I can be (like, able to disconnect and move forward, disassociation and 'fuck it'). 

I am great, until they are subjected to these. Even healthy amounts of them. Well-medicated and therapized amounts. They're still a part of me, I do my best to work around and over them, I am always working to improve, I'm not cruel or dismissive, I'm receptive to criticism, and I'm an empathetic person and I communicate where I am. 

It's just not attractive anymore when someone gets bent up because they did not seem to expect what I told them at the start, what they found attractive in the first place."
5343,bipolar,Bipolar and relationship,"I am in a long distant relationship.

It is the first time that I was manic while dating them. This time my mania was very NSFW and i am at a loss on what to do. I get really strong urges for very personal contact, but that is impossible at the moment.

i am so unsure on what to do. i need some advise."
5344,bipolar,Just was part of a police chase (not the suspect),"I was driving with my gf and her little brother to their older sisters to eat custom popcorn flavors from Popcorn Friday (pretty good popcorn). I just discovered this sub and felt I had my chance to get help figuring this all out especially after tonight. First off if parts make no sense I apologize. Back to the car story... As I was driving a cop car sped past us and I noticed the officer stopped at the weigh station so I told my gf to check the local police scanner. We saw multiple lines mentioning a “motorcycle” being chased going our direction just a couple miles back. Only a couple minutes passed but a lot happened during this time. Multiple cop cars deploying spike strips right as we pass. I assumed the motorcycle was pretty close at this point. I looked in the rearview mirror and see multiple cop cars approaching quite quick. Again I made an assumption that they were rushing to deploy more spikes as my gf was reading that they were. As the cars got closer my gf finally got the update that the spike strip hit and the FRONT LEFT TIRE was blown on the CAR. Figuring out that it was a car at this point was useless because the car was passing by us within inches of my car being chased by about 6 or 7 cars and I only heard my gf screaming pull over which I couldn’t really do safely. All I could feel was adrenaline and just an overload of excitement for such a dangerous moment. Somehow in all of this I was able to keep all of this safe and keep out of the way of the driver and pull to the side of the driver and wait until they disappeared out of sight. After that it was pretty much over and we made it safely to big sister’s. All of this had me thinking and brought me to this sub.

Im a sophomore in college and recently have been talking to a psychiatrist along with my regular psychiatrist about having to normalize my life and deal with PTSD, Generalized Anxiety, Depression and possibly “ADHD” of which isnt the focus at the moment due to just collaborating with these professionals in order to get proper help. The big focus for the last month has been keeping a journal of how im feeling or whats going on every day to help both psychiatrist and psychologist know if im showing obvious symptoms of hypomania and it has my brain feeing like chaos not knowing what to write down and what not to write down. Some things feel obvious like at points im convinced I can’t be killed due to many near death experiences and then other feel less obvious like are my spending habits just a normal 19 year old being shitty with money or can I seriously not help it. Then I can’t tell whether im more aware of what im dealing with or if my brain is just trying to just sift through every possible reason to just be all messed up. I went through 17 out of the 19 years of my life juggling between physical and mental abuse even after being adopted by a “nice christian family” who ended up demonizing everything that I dealt with and calling me a danger to the rest of the family because they were “afraid” of me even though they all miss me and have been contacting me on social media saying so. All of this after being taken away from biological parents who were on drugs to be taken to multiple foster homes that exposed me to abuse and sexual assault only to be sent back to my biological parents who were clean only to soon relapse render us homeless for two years subjecting me to more abuse that I didn’t know how to escape until i became 15 and was taken in and subsequently adopted to the family that demonized me for not being normal. I’m truly not asking for any pity and im not trying to catch a massive amount of attention. Im really just trying to heal these days and the girl that I met in high school and have been with for almost 2 years now has given me more hope than I ever thought existed. Her family taking me in while I was convinced I was going to be homeless just months before I started college. Im trying to figure this all out and like want to know what really im trying to be aware of when searching through my thoughts and feelings in order to make a proper assessment for my psychiatrist to be able to help me. This was also my first chance to vent this all out and was really hard to put together (this all took about 2-3 hours now to type). I thank any help in advance and honestly just appreciate that communities like this can exist."
5345,bipolar,CRAMPS!,"Went off my Risperdal last month and just got my period again. Ugh, the cramps are killing me!"
5347,bipolar,How long did your depression episode last???,"Little bit of history.  First diagnosed with bipolar at 36 when I had my first manic episode where I thought I was Jesus. Then had my second episode when I was 37 and thought the world was a video game and got into a police chase and got tasered. My third manic episode was when I was 38 and thought I was the creator of bitcoin and the worlds richest person. It was a very fun episode. 

In between my three manic episodes I had severe depression and I would stop my meds and get hypo manic then full blown mania. 

My question is, I’m now been depressed since October last year and have been taking my meds religiously but I just can’t seem to shake this depression.  

How long did yours last? Did yours just go away one day?

Of course I know I can stop my meds and I’ll snap out of my depression but that would make me end up in hospital/jail/dead so that’s not an option. 

Any tips on coming out of depression phase?

My doctor suggested lamotrogine but I don’t want to deal with another drug. 

Thanks"
5348,bipolar,"Despite having been manic I have never ever felt truly happy in my life, except for a period of three months","So, I have never ever felt happy, even when i'm manic I guess I feel kinda happy but it an uncomfortable stressed amount of happiness and I don't get manic much. Not as a child, not as a teen, not as an adult, part of that is because I was abused by even before when I was in early early childhood I still just never felt good even when the world was so simple in my eyes then. The only exception I have is a period of three months when I was 16, I actively felt good, I couldn't tell you why but I just did. I created a journal, wrote in it every single day and got out all frustrations and bad feelings, I still felt bad but I felt happy too. I didn't struggle with any sort of dangerous ideation, I went on 2 hours walks everyday in the afternoon, hung out with my dogs and my cat all day and felt so much closer to them than I had ever felt before. The kicker was is that entire summer I was alone, literally spoke to absolutely no one other than my mother who didn't really talk to me at all. I never felt lonely maybe a little sad I couldn't see anyone but at that time I felt truly at peace with myself and felt like I came to terms with everything in my life and was better for it. Then those three months ended, and even with mania, still just don't feel happy and I don't know if I could ever get that feeling of happiness back ever."

6471,bipolar,I got my first credit card today!,I know this seems scary but I have a full proof plan that would require some hardcore effort on my part to fuck it up. Its a secured credit card with 250 on it. I plan on paying it in full twice a month unless thats stupid. I am new and have no credit obviously so i could use some good advice
6473,bipolar,I think I'm ready to retire from working,"It seems fairly certain I'll be laid off from my job soon.

I've given my career 10 years. I've had numerous jobs, a couple different career fields, and none of them have seemed to fulfill me. They all stress me out extremely, causing depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts/actions, which I was just hospitalized for. I tried working for myself, and then I went manic and eventually bankrupt (went through the court proceedings and lost my house and everything). It's been an excruciating life-threatening experience the entire time.

I've tried all the medications. I've tried all the therapy methods. I've tried  the methods of electrifying the brain - TMS/ECT. I've done everything I've been asked to do by doctors, and it's still not enough.

I've been on Social Security Disability (SSDI) before. I would have to re-apply but I think I'd get approved easily. My previous salaries have made the benefit fairly high thankfully.

I like everything else in my life except work.

So I think I'm just going to retire.

I feel at peace with this decision."
6474,bipolar,I Feel Really Bad,"A year ago, I had someone I had grown very close to over the course of several months reveal that they were lying to me about being friends. That sent me into a downward spiral where I became bulimic, manic for two months then numbed out by medication the next four months, tried to kill my self twice, and had an accidental drug overdose brought on by academic stress. It was probably the worst 6 months of my life. 

Today, I learned that my roommate from that time also lied to me about being friends for the entire semester we lived together. She had ghosted me over the summer, and I happened to run into her in my dorm and made her explain. She said I was toxic to be around. It’s just hurt me so bad. I’ve spent the night trying to watch movies and shows to distract myself, but I just feel so sad. I know I have people I can talk to, but I don’t know how. Some of my friends have tried to reassure me that I’m not toxic, but what if I am and everyone’s just lying to me to not hurt my feelings? 

My first thought when I feel bad is that maybe I should kill myself. Maybe this world is better off without me being awful in it. I don’t want to hurt myself. I’m afraid that this is going to send me into another downward spiral. I can’t do that again. It’s just so miserable. Nothing makes it better. 

I really needed somewhere to let this out because I hate worrying people I know. I tried writing about it, but that’s only making me sadder. I need to sleep. I need to reset. Maybe I’ll feel better tomorrow."
6475,bipolar,Trileptal drying me up???,"I’ve been on Trileptal almost a week and I like it so far except for one thing... everything is soooo dry. I’m drinking more water which is good I guess. I’m having to apply chapstick every 30 minutes. And last night while me and my bf were having sex it was much drier than normal, not uncomfortably but a noticeable difference to me. I have oily skin and occasional acne so I’m hoping it dries my skin a little bit since it’s drying literally everything else up lol. 
I hate this! I can’t decide if it’s because we upped my dose of Wellbutrin or if it’s the intro of Trileptal. Does anyone have suggestions for this annoying side effect or has experienced this with their medication? I don’t see my psychiatrist for another week."
6476,bipolar,My boss ghosting me???,"I was hired at a restaurant last week and told I would be contacted Wednesday for my schedule. I texted my boss Tuesday about uniform and no answer. Wednesday night when I wasn’t sent the schedule I texted again. No response. Thursday I tried calling and left a voice message. No response. Friday morning called. No response. Finally Friday evening I tried calling the restaurant and he was “in a meeting”. I left a message and haven’t heard anything since. Am I being ghosted by my new boss? I’m now just assuming that I’m “fired” because I’ve heard nothing. It’s obvious he is ignoring my messages specifically. Idk what to do now because of COVID there are so little jobs available and somehow I have to pay for food, rent, and school in my last year of uni without a job. I feel so silly for being so excited. So I’m now super depressed and feel like shit because my irrational thoughts tell me it is my fault. Ugh sorry this was long"

6480,bipolar,What habits have helped you?,I was diagnosed bipolar in March and find going to bed and waking up at the same time everyday helps me to stay stable.

What habits do you have that help you to stay more stable?
6481,bipolar,"They say I’m a very high-functioning, rapid cycling, BP2 or whatever. BUT I feel like a complete and total imposter. aka, I’m still struggling with my diagnosis (and therapy as I apparently don’t need much)","My psychologist (therapist) agrees that I’m rapid cycling, but that I’m such a one-of-a-kind person and should realize for myself that I am special and have a lot to offer. Don’t feel shamed or guilted thinking it’s a burden to show the world, and myself, that I’m capable, artistic and incredibly life-giving. Ugh.

But I don’t like that and honestly, I know I am—but I’m NOT better or deserve to be—I feel like an imposter because I don’t really share my true self. Or know my true self for that matter. 

Others think they see that I’m high-functioning. True? Yet that’s one of my masks. I come off as chill or energetic and joyful. But fuck me there are times depression or suicidal ideation peeks through that mask. Or times of hypo causing people to question if I’m “on something.” 

Soon as I try to carry my light like I owe it to the world I retreat with a heaviness. People notice and wonder why I get slow and quiet, or pent-up and intense. 

He, my psychologist, said I’m “above normal and needed in this world,” but I hate that. *It feels like an obligation.* Guilt and pressure to do things that are deeply me and sentimental and created in solitude. 

I dunno, I feel like an imposter and that maybe I’m not bipolar2 and I should “get over it” because of how high-functioning i am. I suppose it’s time to stop being afraid of me and share more"

6485,bipolar,All the mental help apps are the same...,"I wish I had an app that would help me make small steps to reach my goal. I’m currently going back n forth between Youper, Daylio, iMood Journal. My therapist talked about path of least resistance. I hate getting notifications to look at the app, but I feel like I’d use it more if I could just do a simple response on the motivation. What’s my mood today? (1-10) and that’s it. If I want to do more I can go back into the app but the idea of HAVING to go in the app to do anything feels overwhelming. 

I also wish I had something that did SMALL step goals. Sometimes I can barely out of bed, or shower. Instead I crawl on the couch to nap, and count that as a success. Or I can’t shower but I wiped my body with a clean wash cloth. But I get so overwhelmed because when I make goals I set the bar way too high. Does anyone else feel the same or am I going crazy? 

I just feel like I can never make progress w traditional health tracking apps. I always end up getting too overwhelmed and nvr touch them again. I rly depend on apps to help me figure all this shit out."

I don't know how people do it, but it is such a relief to hear that someone else has forgiven me and let go of what I've done. Now imagine how much relief and bliss I'd be in if I learned how to forgive myself and let go of my mistakes!

So, what do you do?"

I already had one session and she is extremely nice.
6491,bipolar,Switching from antidepressants after BP diagnosis,"Hi. Has anyone been through something like this? 

After about 9 years on Lexapro my diagnosis changed from depression to BP2. Lexapro at 10mg had always been pretty good. Then it stopped working.  But moving up to 15mg I experienced 'phase switching' from depression to hypomania. Moving back down to 12.5mg sent me straight back to depression (tried to make this dose work for 6 weeks with no change). 

My pdoc suggested i move to Lamictal, but every dose above 50mg brought a lower mood. So now I'm on 15mg Lexapro and 50mg Lamictal. But where do I go from here? I'd like to reduce the Lexapro but fear depression coming back or withdrawal. I'm sure 15mg is too high for BP and caused rapid cycling before I added Lamictal.

Has anyone had this change of diagnosis and removed antidepressants successfully?

Thanks"
6492,bipolar,Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) + Me + Monday = Idk. Can I be declared permanently disabled if this doesn't work?,"Tl;dr at the bottom and how the procedure works near the bottom too, in case strangers on the internet want to read this. 

I guess I just wanted to say all of it at once. You can't go up to someone and tell them your life story. And the people with whom you could discuss your life story already know your life story. I'm not going outside to make a friend in the hopes that one day I can tell them all of my living memories and complain about all the things I've forgotten from the depression and the drugs and the treatment. I guess I could get a diary. I should be writing things down. I forget when to go to the hospital on Monday... 

When I was 15 I became severely depressed. In a matter of two weeks I went from a completely well adjusted, high functioning youth with friends, family, school and interests, to not sleeping at all during the night, dozing for a few hours during the day, eating nothing, missing school, coming home from school, leaving class to nap on a couch and so on. Looked like a zombie, felt like I was dead.

My parents very quickly took me to the doctor, to a teen psych clinic. They got me on Prozac and I think some sleeping medication. I'm 5'6 and went from 125lbs to 110lbs. I took my meds with chocolate milk and my parents force fed me ice cream sandwiches.

At some point I went to a psychiatrist working in private practice. The guy let my parents come for the first appointment and then banned them to give me room to talk, or whatever.

He thought that I'd be able to fall asleep if I read a boring book about naval history. Stupid idea. He thought that I should go to China town and buy ginseng to drink in the mornings for a gentler stimulant than coffee. He then gave me ginseng from a dusty little vial, from a dusty little box and had me drink it without my parents' knowledge. He wanted to analyze my dreams. I told him that I am far beyond the point of counting sheep and talking about my dreams.

At some point I had a reaction to the Prozac which put me into a state of hypomania. It happened on several occasions. Didn't last too long, but it was evident that my behaviour was a very rapid departure from the depression and beyond feeling good or being healthy. I think I was taken back to the initial clinic for a bipolar 2 diagnosis.

I got me a new psychiatrist. He's great.

I thought I'd fail high school. But they were very accommodating and I was a bright student. There was really no way I could fail, but I was highly concerned.

However, I am now 25, it's been 10 years since getting sick, 8 since graduating high school, and I've dropped out of university 5 times and have been employed only a few times, seasonally.

I've been on countless medications. I can't remember them all, probably over 30 and the original psychiatrist wouldn't even forward my file to the new guy, so who knows what I was on back then.

I tried rTMS when it became available. I was hospitalized and got ECT. I'm currently receiving iv ketamine.

Nearly everything has worked... For a few weeks, maybe a few months. Enough to handle a 2-3 month job or think I should sign up for some kind of schooling and subsequently have to drop it before having grades officially recorded. The best I did was one year of school; one year being September to April, minus a month for winter break. By the end I was really pushing it. But I had accommodations at the school and one instructor who really wanted me to succeed. And I finished the year because of him. Went back the next year, left one month in.

So now we have access to the vagus nerve stimulator. Usually used for epilepsy but now it's being covered in my province for depression. I'm not sure if it's actually my healthcare covering it or if it's being funded by the department of psychiatry (the ketamine clinic is somehow funded by them). Anyway, I'm approved for this device.

I'm the first person in the province getting it for this purpose. The surgeon said that he's put in a lot for epilepsy and something else, but under 100. My psychiatrist got training on how to calibrate the device. He's coming to watch the procedure because he's never seen this before and I'm the first one.

I'm so excited... For my psychiatrist. I'm sure he's discussed this with his colleagues. I'm happy he's getting to learn this new thing. This is probably so much better than the zoom appointments he's been doing since covid. I really hope he gets to learn from this and use it again in the future. I feel like I should get him a gift to celebrate the day this tech came here. I discussed this and the ketamine with him long before it was available in my city.

Is it going to work? I don't know. My friend said ""Can you imagine all the things you've gone through over the last 10 years melt away in a few months time?"" (22-55 weeks for full effect). I'm imagining the last 10 years of my life, getting this thing implanted and then it not working.

How they get it in there:

So the VNS consists of a generator, leads and clips. The generator/battery is like a pacemaker. It's the size of an Oreo, but a bit flatter with more tapered edges, it seems. An incision is made not too far below the collarbone on the left side and the generator is placed just beneath the skin. A small 5cm incision is made left of the center of your neck to access the vagus nerve. A tube is fed from one incision site to the other. The leads are put through and the tube is removed. They get attached to the generator at the bottom and clipped onto the nerve at the top. The scar on the neck isn't noticeable as its done on one of the folds of your neck. The wires are not visible. The generator supposedly lays flat and won't be noticeable (we'll see) and there would be a scar. 


Tl;dr
I'm getting a vns on Monday and I'm more excited for my doctor being able to access this new tech than I am for myself, I think. And general description of the last 10 years of my life."
6493,bipolar,Instead of going to school I slept all day.,I was supposed to go to online school but I slept all day. I slept all night but I still slept all day. I’m still tired and it’s 4 in the afternoon. I just wanted to vent I’m just really sad about this
7640,bipolar,"Oh meds, here we go again","After a few years of getting the diagnosis of bipolar, I've finally accepted I need meds. 

Story time. So this all started out with a 5-6 month manic episode in 2015. At the time i was only diagnosed with depression. I had no idea wtf was going on, but i basically was having 24/7 panic attacks with 2ish hours of sleep a night. I felt like my body was on fire, I was barely functioning, and suicidal at the 5 month mark. To put this in perspective, I lost over 15 pounds in 3 months and im only 110 to begin with. I couldnt eat because it felt like i was choking on all the food. I looked like death. One more month and I would have checked in to a psychiatric unit.I went to the doctors and explained my symptoms saying this wasnt normal and that I felt crazy. All my tests came back normal so they sent me to a psychiatrist saying if she can't help me im basically fucked (so helpful right?). 

They put me on Lexapro after my third month in this state and lorazapam for when the panic attacks got even worse then normal. It made my already horrible symptoms worse, which I didn't think was possible. I felt like I was glued to the floor and couldn't move while still feeling just as panicked. It was almost like being in a paralyzed state. To say the least it was traumatizing. I called the doctor and said how awful it made me feel and this wasn't normal. They said stay on it a week and I should feel better. Seriously? I can barely take a few days of this. It took 6 days for it to get out of my system and for me to go back to my ""normal"" manic state. 

I was terrified of meds after this. So I did years of therapy (which helped some) but as any bipolar person knows doesn't usually ""fix"" it. I tried teas, yoga, exercise, meditation, and essential oils. All failed to curb my manic and depressive symptoms. I was rapid cycling (and still am) all the time and I felt like such a failure. Why couldn't I just be ""normal"" after all the hard work I put in to ""fixing"" my mental illness. I mean i basically failed 1.5 years of college because I either was too anxious to be in class or to depressed to move. 

I finally came to the realization that bipolar isn't something you fix. It's something you maintain. And for me this means going back to the only thing I havent tried in years, meds. I'm scared, terrified if im being honest. I dont want to take the wrong one or have meds for the side effects of the meds. I dont want to rely on a pill to make me feel normal. I don't want to lose my spark or be dimmed down by my meds. This is real life though, and I guess nothing good comes without trial and error. 

I'd love to hear your stories on meds. Im hoping it'll make me feel a bit better about the journey im about to be on. Thanks 💜"
7641,bipolar,Do you think stress caused your first episode,I would like to think it’s genetics but there is increasing evidence that stress causes episodes. What do you think was the reason for your first episode?

https://youtu.be/WjDRH9eQ-38"
7644,bipolar,Well worth the wait,Yesterday I found out that my dream college I applied for was accepted and I received a scholarship from them. This is amazing news because I've been taking breaks over the years due to my mental health. I have no one that I can share this good news with that understands everything I'm going through so I thought you guys might enjoy the good news.
7645,bipolar,I need my med but they made me gain 20lbs,"So I was having some pretty bad post patrum depression for like 15 months and then the mania kicked in and it was awful! $13000 of shit I needed and just couldn't tolerate anyone or anything. So I got my emergency antipsychotic added to my ""normal one"" and it caused me to gain 20lbs and I feel awful about that and only that. I eat once a day and not any more than a standard meal and I still can't loose the weight! I fucking hate this. But I'm mentally 'well' I'm doing much better and can tolerate most days. Fucking hate this weight gain like no tomorrow why is that the side effect of every one of these drugs!?"
7646,bipolar,Has anyone had any luck with just... Therapy? Also a rant with possible triggers.,"I'm trying so so so so hard to convince myself to go back to therapy. I think from even before I was diagnosed and just generally seeing therapists as a teenager through now, at 32, I've been to maybe... 9 therapists in total? The problem is I never stick with it. I either have a terrible experience where they're not right for me, or in one somewhat recent case I just felt like an insect because my therapist knew a lot of the same people I did so he just fell too far into the comfort zone and added me on Facebook and everything, he pretty much spent most sessions telling me how self aware I am... Like yes okay but like... Help me? Challenge me? Give me something?

My last therapist I actually liked a lot. I've been thinking about going back to her but... I don't know. It seems like everywhere I go they're overloaded and overworked and I'm not actually getting therapy. Sitting down and rambling about my week or my problems or my stream of consciousness doesn't help me. I can do that with my husband. I need my brain fixed! It doesn't fucking WORK. All I ever get is wow you're very self aware of what's going on and happening to you. I need someone to help me FIX those things. Not admire my ability to recognize them or rationalize them. Neither of those things mean I have any control whatsoever or that my head is not slowly drowning me.

Last therapist started suggesting Seroquel. I'm scared of it honestly. When I first got diagnosed after intensive mania they put me on a huge dose, like 1000mg plus Ambien because I just... Didn't sleep ever. It took awhile but eventually I guess it kicked in but then I felt like a zombie bug inside a jar. I've been on Lamictal I think it was before... It made me completely incapable of telling my dreams from reality and time just blended all together and fucked up. I've been on some other weird cocktail I can't remember anymore that just made me feel like I was constantly dreaming. I don't know what else to try. I'm scared of meds now because they never seem to work right and either tranquilize me completely or just make everything much worse. Last therapist was suggesting trying small doses of Seroquel but like... I don't know. I'm scared.

But. I'm starting to think I just can't do this without medication. I'm broken. The last 20 years of my life feels like I'm barely coping. I wake up everyday hoping to everything I just have a decent mood and nothing triggers it to swing. Half the time I just wake up hopeless. I can't handle tasks anymore. I can't get my sleep schedule to stick to anything remotely normal, and I either sleep too much or never enough. I feel like I can't do anything at all. I sit in a chair most of the day, I do not actually function, I manage to hold my shit together to take care of my toddler and that's about all I have energy for. I've been spiraling inside a depressive episode for I don't know how long now. I have days where it let's up and I actually end up praying to my own mind that I'm flipping manic or into what I call the gray area... But it never comes through and I just fall back into my pit the next day after thinking I've clawed out.

I've got multiple disorders that all work together to make existing hell. Bipolar with apparently a tendency to rapid cycle, according to last therapist, which we were to be looking into further but alas. OCD. PTSD. Generalized anxiety and hypochondria. She was also thinking an undetermined personality disorder but wasn't sure if it was a thing or if it was just my bipolar disorder toeing that line. Idk.

I'm sorry this has turned into a rant. Really my question is has anyone at least like... Managed with just therapy? I guess I don't know what to do. I have a hard time convincing myself to try therapy again because I feel it never does anything for me. I'm scared to try medication. But those seem like my only options at a crossroads I just keep revisiting because I can't find my way around it and I'm quickly losing hope in everything, but I'm stuck in a stasis because I know I can't do anything about not wanting to do this anymore. I don't know what to do. I don't have much of a support system and very few people to encourage me, most people close to me will just tell me I do a really good job of maintaining and dealing with my shit but they also know I'm not doing a good job of it and I'm just miserable all the time and it's just an endless cycle of hell for me, so is that really even maintaining at that point? I'm just existing and hurting deeply at most times, and probably hurting people outside of myself too. I just feel stuck and lost. 

I never get much of a response on reddit and usually feel pretty stupid when I post so I'll probably delete this. But if you read this far, thanks for listening at least."
7647,bipolar,I'm feeling stuck.,"Okay, so I woke up today feeling like everyone was trying to take advantage of me or that nobody really cared. It was strange to think about, but it effectively made me on edge going in to work today, and especially ticked me off when someone asked for my help with doing something for them.

Secondly, I've been having these thought distortions for some reason. A part of me wants to see everything go up in flames, complete destruction as far as the eye can see to levels where I feel like a divine entity waiting to wreak havoc on everything that anyone has worked for. Another part of me would be mortified if I hurt someone and so I keep to myself most of the time. I also feel like sometimes I manipulate people, but I don't know if I'm doing that on purpose or if I'm a genuinely bad person, and I don't even know if I actually am manipulating people in the first place.

As you can see, this is causing a lot of identity issues that doesn't really seem to help me out that much. Not thinking about it isn't really an option since things like this keep replaying in my head over and over again, so the sooner I can get them organized and resolved then the sooner I can go back to feeling like I'm stable again."
7649,bipolar,Doctor is testing me for bipolar soon but confused about mood swings and time periods.,"I am being tested for bipolar/borderline soon. My doctor thinks that I meet criteria for further testing after doing a small assessment with her in person.


The question I have though is about mood swings. My mood swings are based around my surroundings/environment/people near me and they usually change within hours instead of days. My doctor was telling me that with bipolar behaviors can last days at a time, but for me it's more like every few hours and can change super rapidly. Does this sound more borderline than bipolar? I am a bit confused between the two. Thank you in advanced and I apologize if I came off rude!"
7650,bipolar,"Does anyone else experience this? If so, do you have any tips?","This is a throw away because I don't want anyone I know to know I have bipolar, I think they'll look at me differently. Anyway. 

I have been going through a rough patch, it started last night. This isn't the first time but I feel so guilty this time. I feel just so upset. 

I have been doing so much shit. I have dyed my hair, got dinner out multiple times, smoking weed and cigarettes excessively, taking stupid pictures, not sleeping at all, and I don't feel satisfied. I keep feeling the urge to spend more money but no matter how much I spend it doesn't satisfy anything. I just keep doing shit to stop the feeling but it doesn't stop. I want to excessively clean my room so bad, to the point where its driving me crazy but I have to wait for a little help from my friend. I even dyed my hair on a whim today because it just HAD to be done. And still, I feel no satisfaction. I really don't know what to do. I need this to stop, it drives me insane. 

Also, I keep getting upset that my boyfriend is sleeping even though I KNOW he has too. I just feel like I'm in a race and I'm winning but the finish line is nowhere in sight. I don't know much about bipolar disorder, I was diagnosed and my mon said my dad had it and so did his sister. But the session after my diagnosis I had to stop seeing her because my insurance ran out. So, I never got to explore it with her and understand and come up with coping skills. I just want to know why I feel like this. I was told it was ""mania"" but what does that mean? I don't understand it and researching it doesn't help because I can't understand the medical terms. I'm not great with comprehension. I just want this to stop."
7651,bipolar,Trouble maintaining eye contact &amp; Strange emotional responses,"Does anyone else have trouble maintaining eye contact? It’s always been very difficult for me. When I’m talking to people, I cannot keep eye contact for more than a few seconds before permanently looking away. 

Another thing is that maintaining eye contact incites strange emotional responses. If I try to maintain eye contact for more than 5 seconds, I’ll either burst out laughing, or internally rage (wanting to punch something or hurt myself). People are very confused when they see I start to hysterically laugh, and I’m not able to stop laughing until I look away 

Could anyone give insight as to why I’m like this? Why does eye contact evoke strange emotional responses?"
7653,bipolar,Even when I’m not depressed I feel this way....,I think the worst part for me is the loneliness. 😓
7655,bipolar,Struggling to Navigate Bipolar Disorder in College,"Hi, everyone. I could really use some personal insight from people in this thread because no one else seems to understand.

I just started my first semester of college and I received some med changes. My Abilify dosage was increased from 5 mg to 10 mg, I was prescribed 50 mg Trazodone, and I’m on 0.5 mg of Klonopin. 

However, that’s not the real issue here. For the past 4 days, I’ve been having a manic episode with depressive features (mixed). I’ve impulse bought $400 worth of amazon packages, and I’ve also been doing laps around my dorm room at night while trying not to wake my roommate. The Trazodone is doing nothing at the moment to help me sleep. I feel like I could fight god while also feeling passively suicidal. I’ve had manic rage and crying fits at the same time. 

Any tips on how to function properly in college with Bipolar 1? I’m really trying to embrace this new experience and achieve a 4.0, but I fear that this condition may deter me from doing so."
7656,bipolar,I finally found a therapist!,"After moving to a new place half a country away from home, I finally found a therapist who's willing to do sessions for $55 each out of pocket with no insurance! I've been in a constant fight with myself about spending the money since I feel fine at the moment but I know it'll only get harder if I put it off. I'm excited to finally get help again, I'm just a bit nervous history will repeat itself. High hopes though!"
7657,bipolar,My pet peeves,"My dad drives me nuts. He chews with his mouth open, and he is always yawning and burping so I assume he is always bored, uninterested and craving attention. I think that yawning the entire time when I watch anything and burping are super obnoxious and it makes me want to not be around him. Those are quick triggers for me. If he watched something he won’t yawn at all, only if it’s something that I want to see he yawns.  If we are watching a movie, he will look at me throughout the movie as if he is expecting me to react to different parts in that movie when most of the time I don’t have multiple strong reactions. When I do watch my sports he will just continue to ask meaningless questions like where does person x play at? Player y is in the league? And he will ask me these same questions over and over again, often times it’s the same question about the same player. 

Because of these pet peeves I don’t want to be around him at all."
7658,bipolar,Auditory hallucinations?,"So I have Bipolar I and while I’ve had visual hallucinations in the past I’ve never had any auditory. These past two weeks I’ve had two situations that have caught my attention, the first one would be a week and a half ago I was in the bathroom but I started hearing a dog whimpering when we don’t own any pets. Everything was closed so it couldn’t have been outside because of how crystal clear I was hearing it, I thought I was going crazy so after 20 minutes of it I went to sleep. 2nd time was yesterday night while listening to music in my room, I kept hearing heavy footsteps right outside of my door and I checked 6 times but nobody was there, it was very clear it was right next to my door.

Is there any reason why (if they are) I’m getting these types of hallucinations now?"
7660,bipolar,If TD gets better if diagnosed early; why wait?,Either I am understanding TD incorrectly or the meds don’t work or doctors are reluctant to prescribe immediately or you are waiting to get off APs. Which one is it?
7661,bipolar,Left work,"I woke up today depressed as I have been for the last two weeks. 

I showered and got dressed for work and made my way in even though I really did not want to. 

All my staff noticed that I wasn’t right today, I made the excuse that I had a migraine. I cried probably about 5 times over three hours before I decided I had to tell my supervisor I had to leave early because I have a migraine. 

I left and went to my PCP to get a note for leaving early and as soon as the doctor asked me what’s wrong I broke down crying again. She wrote me a note for today and tomorrow. 

I spoke with my shrink yesterday about how I’ve been depressed and he didn’t want to change too much but I think maybe I should give him another call... 

Ugh."
7662,bipolar,Not being taken seriously,"What if my family does not take my Bipolar 1 diagnosis seriously? If I talk about a mood change, they always try to pin it on something else other than the fact that.. hmm... that I have BIPOLAR DISORDER! I am not making excuses or making my diagnosis a part of my personality, I am highly against that. However, when I experience a severe mood change and I discuss it (or at least when I used to since I lost all trust) they would be like “Oh I think it’s because you are stressed with school work” or “It’s because you don’t do anything in your day”. Yes, it’s hard for me to do things in my day when I am in a severe depressive episode, but they believe that I am solely “sad” because I am “lazy”. Also after a manic episode when I’m in a period of regret, they go “Oh I think you were just happy that’s all”. And I’m like what the actual hell because that week when my mom was driving I was being so hyper and yelling and laughing at the top of my lungs and kept pushing my moms arms while she was driving and she had to urge me to stop because we could crash. Or the times where I stood in front of moving cars because I thought I was invincible and nothing could overtake me. That’s very unlike myself! It’s like they are in some sort of denial or I am not sure like wtf. That’s why I almost feel ashamed to talk about my mood changes/mood swings to my Dr’s. Yes they diagnosed me but when they call my mom back into the room I hate it because she doesn’t see anything correctly and if she does then she’s completely in denial. So I’m like why do I even bother saying what I experience to my family or Dr if my family doesn’t take it seriously and then when my mom talks to my Dr she has a different perspective even though MY MOM is the one who brought up that she thinks I have Bipolar to my psychiatrist instead of MDD and after a couple of sessions and such they agreed and I got that diagnosis (Bipolar 1 with psychosis). I’m just confused and feel kind of defeated to be honest. I feel like im trapped in misconceptions, misunderstandings, and invalidations. There’s a lot more to this and I could give elaborate details and examples but I’m just fed up. I just don’t know where to begin to even resolve this."
7664,bipolar,Throwing a towel in the dryer right before taking a shower has me out of bed for the first time in days.,I know a lot of us struggle to bathe when we’re in a depressive episode but this has changed the game for me. It’s like a hug.

I am literally on antipsychotics, and still, my brain functions perfectly fine. I can be funny, I can be charismatic, my analytical thinking works great, and I always know what to say to help a person out.
But when I'm down... As soon as I get depressed, it's like my brain function reduces. My analytical thinking goes haywire, I stop adding up the most obvious things, and I lose my ability to articulate (this post being a proof of that). It's like between all the pain and emptiness and chaotic sadness, my mind becomes so tired, I can't think properly.

I’m also pretty sure I’ve dreamt of the future. I’ve experienced scenes in real life which immediately made me remember that I had previously seen them before in my dreams.

8846,bipolar,Tips please! Tips for an art student with Bipolar Disorder,"I would like to ask for some tips, please! I used to be an engineering student, 5 years ago. But since I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, I wasn't able to finish school. I had been going on and off school within those years. I decided then to try to apply for a job. I got hired, but I resigned after half a year. Now I am studying Graphic Design. I thought I'd do well since it's the program I actually like, but no. I am still the same. I am sure it's mostly because of my medications. Since the day I first took medications, I have been feeling different. I feel weird. I miss my old self. I had thought of these a lot. I think I did so much before I was diagnosed. Now I couldn't do even simple things. I am always unmotivated. When I am, I feel overwhelmed. I don't know anymore. Will I be okay if I stop taking medications? How do you, artists with Bipolar Disorder, deal with all these?"
8849,bipolar,I'm not okay today.,"I'm drowning. 

I'm drowning in voices and mania and paranoia and depression and hate and anger and sadness and shame.  I'm drowning in emotions despite the best attempts by my doctors best attempts to keep me sane.  I'm drowning because I don't have the wherewithal to try and save my brain.  I'm drowning because that state of happiness and calm is impossible to attain.  I'm drowning because my thoughts resemble less a procession and more a crashing train.

I'm drowning in the realization that I'm never going to be whole.  I'm drowning because I know I'll never truly be in control.  I'm drowning because my father left me with unhealing wounds in my soul.  I'm drowning because I have no heroes to look up to or extol.  I'm drowning because my life is entirely without a goal.

I am desperate to try and drag myself to land.  My brain sees through my thoughts and takes back its command.  There are those who see me struggling about but only second hand.  Those close to me watch from a distance as I fail to withstand.

I drown and drown but never die.  I can never understand why.

Why was I born only to suffer every day.  Why was I born only to suffer in this way.  Why do I have to live on because others want me to?  My inability to swim they fail to construe.  I want all of this to end and everything to stop.  Maybe it's time to stop the struggle and make that final drop."

8855,bipolar,Medication not working anymore and it’s wrecking my relationship.,"I am on Wellbutrin 450 mg and abilify 15 mg. Lately I’ve been having a lot of anxiety and feeling extremely depressed. I cry at everything and I’m having suicidal thoughts every night. When I first started taking Wellbutrin, I felt amazing and now i feel like I’m not even taking medication even though I take it every morning. 
My relationship is going down the drain, as I don’t think the guy I’m with can handle my depressed moods. We had a really big fight last month which I know I started due to my paranoia and overall shitty mood. I know I’ve been taking some of it out on him and I’ve apologized and since the last fight I’m trying to control myself, but I think I might have pushed things to their limit. Last week we were together, I started crying when apologizing to him for the things I said when we fought and it seemed as though he had been annoyed that I started crying. I asked him if he were still mad at me and he brought up the crying. It seemed as though he were annoyed that I did. 

I am talking with my doctor tomorrow but does  anyone have any tips for coping with feeling like this or any advice for how I can manage being in a relationship with my mood swings?"

You too ?"
10058,bipolar,Vent/rant,"I feel like I am going in circles. Whenever I talk to my psychologist (every Tuesday and Thursday) I feel like I’m getting no where. However, I am aware it’s most likely due to myself, slightly. Before someone says that I have to be completely transparent to receive the proper help, I understand that completely. But, I have SEVERE trust issues, and after years and years of invalidation, it is utterly hard to say things. In sessions, ever since I started receiving help, I was always told by the therapist/psychologist that I cut myself off and it seems like I can’t form thoughts properly. My current psychologist told me the other week that the way I talk is very all over the place, I VERY MUCH AGREE. I get frustrated whenever I talk, like there’s so many conflicting thoughts in my head or too many that it just all clumps together and becomes... well... nothing. I am not saying this to be dramatic, but to say the full truth. I have so many issues. Like many. Forget about diagnoses for a second, I have many issues, like issues in general. And I feel like my doctors get overwhelmed by this although I am quite vague, but when each session builds and builds, they realize I have many different things at play here, and again, I totally agree. In turn, they try to tackle so many things in one session, and quite frankly, it’s all over the place. I have admitted to my current psychologist and psychiatrist, that there are many things I have not said but not because I don’t want to improve but because I literally cannot. ALSO, I feel like there’s just so much vagueness and generalizations. They say “You need to let go of your past in order to live in the future”. I absolutely agree with that! Very much. However, I do not consciously decide to live in the past, I don’t consciously decide to dwell nor do I see myself as a victim. It’s just that over years of so much shit happening in my life (I’m 18 now), I have learned things as in my brain has learned to perceive things a certain way or has developed its own way of being. When the past is back into my life, it’s involuntarily. I am literally thrown back into a certain incident/traumatic event, as though I am reliving it all over again. To preface, yes, my psychologist and psychiatrist have acknowledged that I most likely have PTSD, BUT, what I am trying to get at is: if I’m in a grocery store, and there are men in that aisle, my heart will start to race and I will start to sweat and feel like those men are going to do something bad to me. I did not consciously have some sort of self talk that was like “Okay, there are men in this aisle, so they might do something bad to me.” It’s more like an instinct at this point, it’s how my brain is “wired” at this point. My issue is all these phrases in my sessions like “You have to put your wall up and know when to let it down” or “You need to live in the present, not the past”. Alright, this is good advice, now tell me HOW? Just give me at least the first step or a hint or a tip on how to do so, but without that, it is simply just a meaningless stream of words in my book. I have been going to therapy for almost exactly 2 years, and not once, but once, have I been given that first stepping stone to execute the advice it tips they give, it’s more just general phrases with no elaboration. I am not expecting a whole abstract on how to go through with the advice, just a little push into the right direction without just saying I “have to do this” with no direction on how to even begin. I have been diagnosed with many things, and to be honest, after one misdiagnosis and missed ones over the past two years, I definitely feel like what I’m diagnosed with is quite accurate. That’s not the issue. It’s how these doctors approach it. Say as many words as you want, but if there’s no sense of direction into how to get better then what do y’all want me to do? I have told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I wanted to discontinue seeing them because I was so fed up with therapy in general and said some things to excuse me leaving. But both of them, on their own separate devices, told me they do not advise that as I am in a very dark place. First of all, when am I not? Either I’m rock bottom or manic or my moods are completely all over the place. And second, I just feel at a loss. They both even said if I would like to see someone else they would be fine with it but that isn’t the issue. I have seen 1 therapist and two psychologists and 2 PA’s and one actual psychiatrist in the past two years and have tried like 12 meds in LESS than two years. I can not and I mean I CAN NOT open up to one more goddamn person about my issues, I feel like a part of me withers away when I do because I always regret it. I always hold myself back, I feel shame, and in some way or another I am invalidated. In all 2 years of receiving help, I have fully cooperated. But my psychiatrist was giving me meds that were in the yellow/red zone (gene sight test) and then wonders why my meds didn’t work. My body is very iffy with meds and a lot of them are in the yellow/red zone but I am aware that there are meds I can try that are in the green zone, he just doesn’t give them I’m not sure why or if there’s even a reason why. I stopped taking meds completely at the end of July 2020 and I feel the exact same. No meds have ever had an impact on me, not because I solely rely on meds, or because I don’t try, just because basically all of them were in the red zone. I feel so much guilt and shame just so much. Imagine taking 4 different types of meds multiples times a day when you are 17 and none of them having an impact. I am sure my diagnosis’s are correct and my doctors seem to think so too, I just don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me?! Literally in my first 8 months of taking meds, my PA literally suggested ECT. I obviously said no but I just look back and say what the hell? Not even a year into taking meds or getting help and you want to suggest ECT? I felt so hopeless and broken. This “vent” is all over the place and very lengthy and I apologize. This isn’t even 6% of what’s been going on or what’s in my head or what has happened in the past, but I’m too frustrated to write it all out and also it would be the length of all the Harry Potter books if I did so. Thank you for reading. Remember: you are valid!"
10059,bipolar,"High BP and ""calm"" anxiety after four days of Vraylar","Is this normal? Does it go away? My bf has been having anxious thoughts but not lashing out like he normally would. He felt like he wanted to cry and tears getting ready in his eyes but he didnt . He was at normal and/or high mood range when he started them but was due for depression (based on mood tracking) that hasnt hit yet.
He got hungry, wanted fast food, then said every fast food place sucked and went on a rant about it until I just drove us to Subway then he was perfectly fine. Normally after a tangent like that he wouldn't eat.

Idk I cant find anything on the internet about what to do if his blood pressure is so high. When we were cuddling last night I could feel his heart through his back beating hard and his hands were shaky. I keep thinking he will have a stroke or something, he said he didnt feel good and hes feeling the heat too.

 He really needs to be on SOMETHING but this us his first bp1 diagnosis and first time being treated with meds that are actually for bipolar, and be is already displaying infrequent side effects so we are scared that nothing will work. He is pretty sensitive to basic products like soaps and stuff so idk if that has anything to do with it."
10060,bipolar,Two Days Left on Seroquel. What should I use in preparation for withdrawal?,"I started Seroquel this July, and let's say, we're not compatible to put it nicely. Dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, and restless legs came with this drug. At first, my doctor put me on 100 mg and I slept for two days. After those days ended, I no longer slept and the doctor upped my dosage to 400 (but I only did 300 mg). After a few days and I mean few, I decided I did not want to continue the upped dosage and tapered back to 100 mg. I learned how to pill cut down to 50 mg for another two weeks and finally I'm on 25 mg. Come this Saturday I'm done. 

I expect a mild to moderate withdrawal (I was feeling some effects as I tapered down). I bought Melatonin, sleep bath, valerian and lemon balm to have at my disposal in case insomnia strikes (My sleep has pretty much been broken). Should I have anything else handy?"
10062,bipolar,HELP,"Hi. I'm 18 years old and have suffered with mental health issues MY WHOLE LIFE. My parents never knew what it was, neither did the endless number of psychiatrists I've seen throughout my life. My dad has bipolar and so does his father and it goes back pretty much every generation. I've always thought that I've had bipolar; I suffer from major mood swings, go into incredibly deep depressive states and then have manic days where I'm bouncing off the walls. I've been taking Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride) for the past 3 years and whilst this isn't a bipolar medication it's sort of worked. Emphasis on sort of. The hardest part about all of this is that I know I'm not properly diagnosed and so I have no idea what the hell is going on in my head. My mother and I argue constantly and I'm not sure if it's a subconscious 'teenage rebellion' thing or if our personalities just clash! She gets upset when I get angry and argumentative (UNDERSTANDABLE) but the hardest part for me is when my mood swing kicks in and I'm suddenly alright again. But I'm not just alright, I'm manic. Constantly trying to be all happy and friendly and it drives her mad. In the midst of it I don't even realise what the problem is. ""I'm being good, aren't I? I'm being calm and friendly again?""- the phrases that constantly run through my head. And then I end up right back where I started- I'm upset and angry because I don't understand what I've done wrong. The most frustrating thing is when I'm happy right from the start of the day. I wake up in a good mood. I'm proactive. I eat breakfast, I go to the gym, I take the dog for a walk. And still my mother is angry. I'm being annoying. I ask her why? The sentence she ALWAYS uses is this: ""You can't just expect us all to pander to your mood when you feel like changing it."" There response I have to this (always internally though because my emotions only come to me at the most inconvenient of times and usually an hour too late!) is as follows: I can't control my mood. It's a cyclic process and, from my own analysis, goes something like this: I am angry, grumpy or depressed. The former two are usually triggered by something ridiculously stupid but the latter is usually a long-term issue. Sometimes it's linked with the seasons, sometimes it's linked with my social life, school work, relationships etc. When I get into these 'negative' moods I get argumentative and shout and get angry and this usually lasts about an hour. I then storm off, reflect on what has just happened and feel guilty. My mood swing doesn't even happen upon reflection of my previous mood. I don't consciously realise what is happening, I just suddenly AM happy. I then make my way back to the absolute shit show that I've just left behind, happy as a daisy. Quite frankly, I'd want to punch myself in the face if I saw this happening. We are then faced with the comment from my mother that I mentioned above. Two outcomes: I start and argument or I start crying and leave. At this point I probably won't see the rest of my family till the next day. In my mind this is GOOD. Everyone has time to cool off (mainly me) and we can all meet back tomorrow with a blank slate. But that's not how it works, a fact I've only recently come to realise after the many, many 'episodes' like these. My mental health is probably one of the main reasons why I'm studying medicinal and biological chemistry at uni. I didn't realise that this was probably quite a contributing factor to my course choice until several months after I'd applied. I always wanted to know what the FUCK was going on in that brain of mine and so I guess it rang its alarm bells and is now going to try and cure itself! All of this is being written moments after my mother told me I had been annoying today. I didn't know why. I made lunch. I took the dog for a walk (she did have to ask me several times), I tried to be friendly and chat to her. One of the hardest parts of all of this is that I have to have the last word. Not because I want to win the argument or because I like to feel dominant. It is purely because I cannot leave things alone. If my mother says I've done something wrong I CAN'T leave until I have been given a detailed list of exactly what I did. I can't brush things under the carpet, I can't just let it be (sorry Paul). I think that's why a lot of the time I just start shouting. It's easier for me to physically not be able to argue anymore if my throat feels like I've swallowed knives from all the screaming and I can barely breath from all the crying. Otherwise I'm relentless. I need to know what is happening. If I can't comprehend my own emotions and emotional state, let me at least be given some qualitative information on what I've done. That I can deal with. I have so much I want to say and this almost feels like writing a diary, which I've never actually done. Sometimes the emotions and thoughts just become too much and I don't know when my head is screwed on the right way. I doubt my own judgement a lot and that can be very difficult because I don't know when I'm right and when I'm wrong. I feel like a lot of the time I just listen to what my mother says and assume she is right without considering how I feel. But that's easier because I rarely know how I do feel and so when those emotions decide to come out, I don't really know what to do with them. So this is good for me. I have one final thing to say. When I started writing this (about 20 minutes ago) I titled the post 'HELP!' because I was crying and angry. Now I don't want to title it 'HELP!' (sorry John). I guess you could say this has been quite therapeutic then. I think I'm done now."

10065,bipolar,Friend is punishing me for being suicidal - what would you do?,"Hey all. I was just wondering what you think I should do in this situation as it’s really bothering me. Be warned, it includes suicidal thoughts/attempt.
I’ve been getting lower and lower in mood, and struggling to take my medication. Last week I ‘went missing’, got purposefully drunk, got on the train tracks near my house and waited for the train to come. Somebody came at the last minute and lifted me off the tracks, hence why I’m here to tell the tale. My friends and boyfriend are all being very supportive - apart from one close friend. The next day she had a go at me about the attempt and about various other trivial things and she’s refused to speak to me since. We usually talk every day. She has told our other friend that not only is she pissed off with me about trying to kill myself but she also just can’t be doing with me in general and ‘needs a break’. 
Is it reasonable for me to think that this is not good behaviour? Should I contact her? I’ve been there for her lots of times when she’s needed me. But because my behaviour was pretty outrageous and I’m still feeling down I can’t decide if I deserve this or not. Any help would be appreciated."
10066,bipolar,How do I cope with feelings and emotions again?,"This is sort of meds related, but more of an oh shit, how do I deal/act like a ""regular"" human person thing.

Recently had several major meds changes and I'm seeing some progress. So there's that. Thing is, I didn't realize how numb I was, emotionally speaking. I'm still depressed, though it's lessened a bit, but holy crap I have *so. many. feelings.*

The littlest things make me cry, and I can get very angry when frustrated. More than is ""appropriate"" to the situation. Can't find my pen? Now I want to scream and punch walls. I haven't done that, at least, so I seem to have some control. It's just really overwhelming. I'm worried I'm going to blow up at my partner over something trivial. 

Emotional dysregulation has been an issue before, and may be a related to ADHD as well as BP1. But therapy, inpatient, IOP's, DBT, and meds over the years made it much easier. Plus no more self-medicating like I did in my teens and most of my 20s. But it's like I've (mostly) lost the ability to rein in strong emotions. Although, thinking back, I guess the issue was more that I wasn't having them in the first place.

Anyway, this is mostly just rambling, but I wanted to get it out to people who can maybe relate. I suppose it's ultimately good to be feeling things again, and I'm definitely not manic or hypo, but what do I do? I feel like a toddler right now, emotionally-speaking.

Thanks for the space to vent."

10071,bipolar,My manic episode destroyed me,"I had a severe manic episode this summer. I thought I saw famous people on the streets and I thought I was adopted and that these famous people were coming to rescue me. I went out SCREAMING (thinking that I was fucking adopted) on the streets. I was so out of my mind, only to later get diagnosed with BPD. But I'm quite sure I'm bipolar as well. I was manic as FUCK, days before this I had a panic attack and had to be sent to the hospital. I cried SO much, laughed SO much, got SO irritated, got SO angry, got SO emotional. I had mood swings throughout the day, but I was still so manic. I had a full-blown mania, something I've never had before. Now I'm entering a normal episode and I want to CRY because of the things I said and did. I regret it so much. I can't get further into detail, but I would really appreciate it if you gave me some advice on how to come over this event, and if you could share an embarassing thing you did during a manic episode as well (as consolation to a fellow bipolar person).

I'm freaking out. Please. Help. Me.

 I tried to kill myself a few days ago. I can't handle myself. I have gone to the mental hospital but they just want to send me back to therapy. 

When I met my school's new freshmen (I'm a sophomore), they thought I was crazy. They literally said I was. I have no control over my emotions. I'm also very sensitive to medicine, if it matters.  

I don't know what to do. Maybe time will heal this. My biggest concern is: what if something like this happens again? I have never been through anything this severe before."

I’m 20 and never had a boyfriend and now I never will. I can’t look in a mirror. None of my clothes fit and I have no energy. I need to lose weight and and as fast as I can do it safely. I know antipsychotics cause weight gain and I don’t whether that’s because it makes you more hungry or because it slows your metabolism. If it effects your metabolism than I don’t want to take it. I need to lose 100 pounds. I lost my whole life to obesity and I can’t  lose my 20s too. I want to die. If this is the choice I have to make then whats the point of living? I’ll be miserable either way. The only time I was ever happy and healthy was when I was losing weight and I wasn’t even on medication at the time. I hate my weight. Maybe some people can be happy heavy but I’m not one of them. I know I’m not, it’s one of my biggest triggers and I can’t keep doing this. Has anyone successfully lost weight while starting Risperdal?"

10075,bipolar,Crises Response - A Conspiracy,"I live in a hotel. I have my kids for the weekend and we've been getting out and taking walks. I am also manic. My doctor's office and my family are very aware of this fact and I am still in control. Last night my kids and I were taking a walk. Suddenly my children asked me why is this person following us? I turned and the door panel read crisis response team the exact name that my doctor's office calls their crisis response team (makes sense). This threw me into a panic as I don't need intervention yet and my kids are with me. The people in the vehicle followed us slowly around the entire building. Now here's the fun part.

I call my sister to see if she called them on me. Historically it is always been her. As I went on to explain what was happening she just continued to ask me if I was okay. She completely undermined my concern because I'm sick. After 30 minute conversation she finally came to understand and did not apologize and did not retract. It sucks and it concerns me that I can have a serious issue and be completely outright ignored or Worse seen as crazy and not able to receive help. I fucking hate this condition and I'm done with it. Have any of you come up with a cure?

I used talk-to-text Dreyfus. My trimmer and involuntary muscle movement are out of control. I apologize for any issues I will try to correct them."
10077,bipolar,My current downward spiral,"I’ve (26f) been lurking on here for a while now and felt I could share. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 around 10 years ago. I was reluctant of the diagnosis and took several years to seek help. Then, I was in therapy weekly and getting on meds. I did everything and after years of not feeling myself and being on 7 meds at once (still expensive with insurance) I slowly stepped back from it all. 

I moved and at that point was off meds. I know that’s not recommended. It wasn’t my intention to go off the grid on any treatment. I moved to a different state and the waiting lists were long as a new patient. Then covid began and it’s not been much easier to find a provider. There’s also the additional financial difficulties with covid.  Frankly, I have bills that need to be paid and there’s not much if any left for prescriptions and appointments. This isn’t me complaining but explaining what has driven me to this where I’m off meds and not in therapy. Yes, I could of probably done a lot different but my mind wasn’t there for it. 

This last month or so has been difficult for me and I started to spiral. I was drinking more , self medicating and spending more than I should be. I’ve been putting myself in a lot of risky sexual situations that I by no means am proud of. 

I know what I’m doing is horrible yet as I sit alone too long, my mind races in too many directions. I go back to doing these things and I feel like it’s not me doing it all. I have no emotion towards it. I’m full steam ahead on this reckless train. 

I’m not sure where this leads me. I don’t know where I begin to pick up pieces. This is kind of a vent or me being fully honest somewhere and seeing if anyone has this happen to them? I feel alone and looking for anyone who can relate."
10078,bipolar,Bipolar rage and recently diagnosed,"i’m a teenage girl, 19 , and a college student. perfect recipe to not be taken seriously. 

i got diagnosed in january after being prescribed lexapro and having a manic episode. i was in denial in highschool when i was sent to the school psychologist and he hinted at the idea. i denied it when my therapist said i should consider it. and i down played my symptoms to my psychiatrist cause i didn’t even take myself seriously. even now people joke about it and say i’m just “moody”

cut to now and the bipolar rage is overpowering. i’ve had manic episodes when i hear things and depressive stages when i was catatonic. but this rage is new. i screamed and shoved my dog when she got in my way and cried about it 4 hours later. i’ve daydreamed about throwing items across the room that didn’t belong to me just to make other people angry too. my boyfriend of two years, who has been with me before, during, and after my diagnosis, makes me the most angry. i’ve found my self saying mean shit but in the most underhanded/ passive aggressive way because i can’t blow up at him because he hasnt done anything. we rarely fight and he’s saved me from the worst and held me when i heard voices but now the sight of him pissed me off and i want to scream and i have. idk what to do. i’ve never really been mad at him before. i feel so ashamed and confused and of course ~ angry ~ 

btw i take meds but they kinda ain’t shit, i loved my antipsychotics but they gave me twitches so i had to switch :("
10079,bipolar,How Do I Make the Horny Stop???,"I'm freaking out, Reddit fronds!
My boyfriend is on the verge of breaking up because I can't sit through a family dinner with him. 

When I'm hypersexual, it's like I have blinders on. I literally can't focus on anything but sex until I get relief. I end up compulsively flirting with him in inappropriate ways, and it makes his family super uncomfortable.

I'm like this almost three weeks out the month. One moment, I'm going about my day. The next, I'm craving sex with every fiber of my being. Sometimes, masturbating will resolve the issue; but as often as not, it doesn't go away. 

Does anyone else deal with this?
I'm at my wit's end here, and I'd love any tips you can give me.
Thanks in advance."
11300,bipolar,My undergraduate tesis is being published!!,"Was only diagnosed after finishing undergrad.

Took me 8 years for getting a 6 year long degree, 3 more working on my degree exam.

Failing my degree exam 4 times and getting a thesis out of pity.

Being called lazy, mediocre and a waste of enrollment space by teachers.

Being suicidal, feeling worthless, waste of resources.

I had this great teacher that took me in out of pity. She gave me a chance and I did my best.


All this time, I was not lazy or stupid. I was fighting against my own brain. Turns out that, stable, I am a quite smart person.

I am getting published in a really important journal.

This it is, peak me. I am smart.
Hard to believe.


Took me 11 years, but I did it. Not only achieved and got my degree, getting undergrad tesis published and in this journal is like winning an Oscar"
11301,bipolar,Anyone else get these almost “Depressed Tourettes” like symptoms when there by themselves?,I’ll get moments where Ill think of something that I regret doing (It can be a small regret or a large regret) and my whole body locks up and I can’t stop repeating “I hate myself” or “I want to kill myself” or some awful swear word over and over again sometimes being extremely loud when I do so. It’s like I’m having extreme Tourette’s or something and it feels impossible to get out of it.
11302,bipolar,Delusions and psychosis in bipolar.,"I was recently diagnosed with bipolar, and even more recently, have experienced psychotic symptoms which I was hospitalized for. these psychotic symptoms are currently following a manic phase. I was wondering if the psychotic symptoms would (if it's just bipolar with psychotic features) go away when my mood stabilizes or does it require medication regardless? I'm asking because I'm confused about the diagnosis of bipolar with psychotic features vs schizoaffective disorder. since schizo requires psychosis for at least 6 months right? that means bipolar psychosis would have to go away by itself right? otherwise, you would be schizo?

Thanks and sorry if this was confusing to read, kinda in a rush."
11303,bipolar,Which things your relatives can do to make you feel better in a breakdown?,"Hello everybody, this is my first post here and I'm seeking for advice (not medical). I'm really worried about my younger brother, he's 22 years old and he has been fighting with maniac and depressive periodes since our father died 5 years ago. One month ago, our grandfather suicided and my brother got really worse, starting to smoke weed again and finally reaching the point to nearly kill himself due to drugs abuse.
Yesterday he had to get in to a hospital by force because he was very agressive and he told me that he was hearing voices about suicide... I know he's in good hands now but I can't help to feel useless and helpless about it all. 
I would like to know if I can do anything to improve the state he's in, if you can share what behaviours or acts your family did that make you feel better in this difficult situations would mean the world to me.. 

Thank you very much."

I made a tattoo appointment with a guy who's work looks good but he's only been tattooing for a year and a half.

11306,bipolar,I REALLY need some advice. What should I do if I’m having homicidal thoughts?,"I have never been homicidal in my life. I experienced suicidal thoughts/attempts for years, been on medicine, diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and in the process of being assessed for bipolar. I have not recently changed medicine. Idk what’s happening because I’ve always had compassion for people. The last day or so I have felt like I could care less and thought about gory things. I’m so freaking scared and I can’t tell my family. Any advice? I’d love to say I wouldn’t do anything but sometimes I don’t think clearly. Please help me."

There's so much going on in the world right now to mourn. People are being murdered for the color of their skin in the streets. People are dying of a pandemic that didn't have to be this bad. People are dying at home, overdosing on the drugs their doctors told them were safe for their use. And nothing is being done.

And me sitting here, just another mentally ill, queer addict, living alone and unable to access support systems I should have to help keep me sane and sober. Just wishing I could be one of those lucky people who was dying. Because it's not just today that my heart hurts, it's every damn day.

Normies don't *get* how much existing hurts. But it's all we can do. Exist and stay alive and try and make things better. Even though it hurts. 

Fuck."

I just feel rather sad and alone right now, as well as tired. Of what am I tired of? Well, lots of things. I'm just checked out right now.

11312,bipolar,😴How do you fight bipolar related fatigue?🥱,"Hi, so last year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I was as stubborn for years and years going to therapy from middle school to my third year of college- I have never done the things to improve on myself. Such as meditating and eating healthy and working out. I finally begun to manage bipolar, by doing those things but now my only problem is the fatigue. Sometimes I let my mania get to me and I’ll stay up for hours being super productive and just doing things I love. I’ll wake up feeling fine but when I go to work in the middle of the day I will feel really fatigued and tired. You can see it in my face too. Even times that I go out, like to the mall, when I would drive back home the fatigue would pop out of no where and be so bad that I couldn’t drive. I would beg the person next to me to start driving. I really want to fight this battle and would love to hear anyone’s tips and tricks on what they do to fight the bipolar related fatigue. I particularly would like to know how you fight it in the moment rather than trying to achieve a long-term habit on fixing your sleep schedule. In the long run I do wanna fix my sleep schedule and just force myself to sleep when I’m manic but as you know that is difficult. So for now what are you doing to fight the bipolar related fatigue? 
—-Please don’t say anything about drinking coffee or having sugar because those come with a bigger downfall of fatigue and are not beneficial. ——-

I read an article that working out can help boost your energy, but I’m just stuck on what workout I should do. I’m curious if anyone has specific routine on what they do!


Any help is appreciated thank you&lt;3"
11314,bipolar,Fucking Bills,"I had started therapy and meds a few months ago and was told that it was free of charge because of my insurance. Got sent a bill for $950 followed by nine bills for $700+. My therapist is a fucking socially awkward loser who I don’t need. I’m not paying that shit, I’ve fucked my credit before I’ve even got a credit card. Guess I’m living off of debit for the rest of my life. Didn’t trust credit cards anyway......"
11315,bipolar,Unable to get help.,"I’ve been suicidal for about two weeks. Severe intrusive thoughts. Severe depression. I have insurance. I’ve called several doctors and they won’t see me without a referral. My primary doesn’t deal with psychiatric, attempted to change primary and they said they won’t see me while depressed unless I go to the ER or a care facility. I’ve spent 4 days looking for a doctor, finally caved and called the ER to see about outpatient care. They said don’t come in they don’t handle psychiatric conditions and that I should go to this other place close (really trying to avoid because they have lots of drug use and negative issues that I feel would just push me over the edge or into heavy drug use).

What the fucks wrong with this country. 
I want to die, it know it’s wrong.I want help but I can’t get it. I need help. I can’t do inpatient because I have to work or I lose everything.

Just needed to get this off my chest."
11316,bipolar,Hoping to help my son.,"I'm going to write a fairly long post here, my son is 12 now and over the past two years his mental health has been getting worse and we're having trouble determining what is going on. 

Approx two years ago (winter 2018) he came down with a stomach ache and would throw up.  He missed about 2 weeks of school, the doctor couldn't find anything wrong.  His school at the time was seemingly going well, he had lots of friends, is very intelligent so it was an odd thing.

Fast forward to about a year from that (winter 2019) and about the same thing started happening, he complained of a stomach ache and refused to go to school, we took him to the doctor and he would barely speak to her about why he couldn't go to school.  After a few weeks of missed school he began going back to school.  During this time he also played competitive basketball, something he enjoyed and was good at, he decided to quit and has never played again..

That school year ended and the summer started (summer 2019), my wife and I had camps set up for him (he was 11 at the time).  One of the camps was an overnight camp that he wanted to go to but on the day of he had a panic attack and actually ran away from us as we tried to get him to go..  We had him stay home with us for a few nights and he decided to go afterwards..  That same summer, he flat out refused to go to other camps we had scheduled and would get angry when we tried to get him to go or do something.. He began spending more time playing video games/watching Youtube.  

Around this time he was also becoming more angry and aggressive when asked to do things like get off of the video games. He would get into really bad fights with his brother to the point where he would threaten him with knives.  During his anger outbursts he would smash pictures (mostly of himself), punch holes in walls throw eggs in the house or anything he could get his hands on.  His anger was not proportionate to the situation.. If his brother was in the room with him, just that could start a fight.  Around this time when he would get upset he would sometimes lock himself in the bathroom and bang his head against the wall... He would also sometime just cry in his room.  I would sit with him and try and console him but he was sad/depressed and didn;t know why.  My wife and began taking him to a therapist to see what was going on.  My son went to two sessions but then refused to go anymore.. 

As summer ended and school began (fall 2019) his anger increased until one day during a fight he pulled a knife out of the kitchen and went after his older brother.. My wife was caught in the middle of it and I was at work at the time.. I told her to call the police (something the therapist had told me to do).  When the police came my son was hiding behind the furnace having a panic attack.  It took a about an hour to get him out, again he wouldn't speak to the officers.  The officers required us to take him to the hospital emergency.  I went with my son and had the officer escort us.  The good news from all this was we got to see a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist speculated that my son had Generalized Anxiety and prescribed him Celexa.  
After one or two days of taking Celexa he confided in me that he has been sad (depressed) for the past two years and he doesn't know why, it just started.  He also confided in me that when he was much younger he thought he was smarter than everyone else and was an older adult in a child's body or maybe he was reincarnated.  During this time he mentioned that he had been seeing things and that these hallucinations started in the summer of 2019 (around the time he went to the camp).   


As we continued the Celexa we noticed he would get extremely hyper/silly after taking it (mostly in the evening).  For long periods of time he would run up and down the hallway in our house and slide on the hardwood head first.  He would also roll around on the floor for hours.  We told the doctor this and we stopped the Celexa (he was on it for about a week) and he prescribed Seroquel.  

I should also mention that around this time he completely stopped going to school.  His personal hygiene, brushing teeth, changing clothes, showering all slowed down or completely stopped at times.  He also refused to get his haircut.  He rarely would leave the house.  He also has major problems getting to sleep at night.   

So we started the Seroquel (standard release) but he was still very angry and would go after his brother.  Finally with all the depression/anger banging his head on the walls I somehow got him to go back to the hospital.  When we got to emergency he was placed in a room and continued to bang his head on the wall. The nurse gave him some meds that had a paradoxical effect and instead of calming him made him uber paranoid/agitated and he was restrained and taken in as an inpatient.  He spent two weeks as an inpatient (I stayed with him during this time).  The end result was they now thought he had some kind of PTSD from fights with his older brother and also has GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder).

When we got released from the hospital we were assigned a new psychiatrist.  We've been working with him for the past 5 months or so and now have tried a variety of meds including Effexor, Seroquel XR, Abilify.. Nothing seemed to work.   Although he no longer sees thing, he does now hear things, and this generally happens in the evening.  He doesn't like to talk about it and has never told me what exactly he is hearing.

And now we are here (Summer/Fall of 2020). He is now completely off of meds and still cannot brush his teeth, change clothes, bath.. Going outside is hard for him to do. He spends his days waking up, playing video games, barely eating then at night time when the day is winding down he starts to get hyper/anxious/depressed all at once.. He says he can't describe it other then he doesn't feel well. When he is in these states he can either looked depressed to me or he wants to play fight me and gets really silly and odd.  


I should mention that we have a family history of Manic Depression/BiPolar, his Grandmother on his moms side had it..  We also had a genetic test done on his that points to drugs to stay away from.  The whole SSRI class of drugs is not recommended for him.  


I'm posting this because I'm wondering what is wrong with him.  Sometimes I think its major anxiety/depression or even schizophrenia.  But what I really think he has is bipolar because of the family history, his reaction to the Celexa and the anxiety and depression... But I really don't know..     


Whatever it is I want to help him and take some of the burden off of him.  Due to his age the psychiatrist is not willing to entertain bipolar.  But I think it has more to do with find the correct expert to help with a diagnoses and appropriate treatment..  


If you got this far, thanks for reading my story.  The last two years has been a struggle and has really opened my eyes to the world and challenges of mental health.  Lots of people are dealing with some real shit in their lives and we all need to be more caring and compassionate..  


Cheers,"
11317,bipolar,Smoking weed or drinking with bp?,"Anyone else have a doctor who tells them they can’t smoke weed or drink ever again? I had an episode this summer and I’ve been sober for 4 months but honestly can’t imagine not ever smoking weed again. I needed that shit to get through the day. 

I’m on medicine now and taking it religiously, but when my 6 month sobriety comes up I plan on smoking again. Anyone have any experience? Doc says I can never smoke again and it literally fills me with despair. Guidance?"
11318,bipolar,I’m depressed. Ew,"I feel so apathetic. I would rather post on this sub than talk about my stupid feelings because I hate hearing myself sound like a broken record for the billionth time. I just feel nothing. I have had no med changes. I have no spark or joy in me. Every day feels longer than the day before. I feel nothing. I have been daydreaming about returning to my hometown and finding my H dealer and just falling back into complacency because it’s easier than trying this fucking hard every day to not fall off the wagon. I have a reason to live now which is almost frustrating because before I could just be as reckless as I wanted and no one would care. Now I have to watch out for my fiancées feelings because he actually loves me and I hate hurting him. I just want to disappear. I feel like an angsty 13 year old. Fuck this terrible world and all the hatred. I want to give up but I can’t and it’s frustrating.

Edit: just got my test results back for hormonal imbalance and it all came back NORMAL so I guess I can’t explain way my mood disorder anymore. Dammit"

11320,bipolar,Racing thoughts when euthymic/stable?,Does anyone else have nonstop racing thoughts even when they’re not manic? The only way I can slow them down is through alcohol. Are there any meds that target racing thoughts?
11321,bipolar,Do you ever question why you mess things up?,"I hate being like this. This is more a vent post than anything, but god I hate the voices and the way my brain just is dead set on doing things. I just ruined a great relationship and I don’t know why I did it. My brain says I’m lonely and need validation from others but I was genuinely happy, I just want everything to stop. Why the fuck did I take a 7 hour drive to virgina at the spur of the moment for no reason, why why why why do I do these impulsive things. I want the dissociation to stop, I want to stop needing validation, I want everything to stop. I just feel so alone and so fucking tired of myself. 

It’s like feeling suicidal but I don’t actually want to die, I just want to stop being like this, to stop hurting the people around me, to stop getting angry, to stop disconnecting from the world and dissociating all day, and stop everything. Why can’t it just stop?"
11322,bipolar,Are there non-bipolar explanations for my mood changes?,"I'm wondering is this type of pattern is typical for unipolar depression. My current diagnoses is MDD (psychiatrist doesn't want to mention bipolar), but the mood swings I'm having are completely bizarre. 

After tracking my depressive episode for 3 months I'm seeing basically the same daily pattern.

**First 10 minutes waking up:** Feeling energetic. Somewhat positive about life and ready to go

**2-3 hours after waking up:** Feeling little more depressed but still energetic

**4-5 hours after waking up:** Negative thoughts appearing from nowhere. Feeling sad

**6 hours after waking up:** Complete mental anguish

**Rest of day/night:** Depression lessening

**Before bed:** Energetic. Sometimes depression even goes away

There's a 50% chance I won't feel energy upon waking up or before going to bed. Before this depressive episode I was having energetic lows and weird mixed (?) episodes where I felt pumped up on adrenaline.

I doubt I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and my moods don't correlate with any life events."
11323,bipolar,Keeping promises to myself,"Something that ive been working on is keeping promises to myself. To me that includes limiting myself, which seemed counterproductive to me at first but its been really helpful to me.
An example would be when i tell myself im gonna clean one thing and then im done for the day, lets say the bathroom. Most of the time ill clean the bathroom and think ""well im feeling like im on a roll right now and the cleaning stuff is all out so i might as well keep going"" and ill feel all proud of myself for getting so much done. But the next time i need to motivate myself to clean and ill say ""I'll just clean the closet and then im done"" and then ill think ""but i always say that and never do and i dont wanna keep cleaning"" and its so hard to motivate myself to clean because i dont trust myself to keep my word, so it doesn't feel like theres an end in sight.
Or, since my brain keeps going forever in loops, ill think ""okay ill just clean the bathroom, but if im feeling up to it ill keep cleaning and what should be next? Probably the kitchen because ill have the cleaning supplies out, but i could also do the surfaces in thw living room, but if i wanna do that I'll have to clear everything off the table and organize the livingrooma bit, but i really need to do that anyways... Maybe i should..."" and keep going and going and then ita night and i go to bed without doing anything.
When i set the goal of ""just the bathroom"" i stop myself from spiraling in thought trains because i know that im actually going to stop when i say im going to.

I was just thinking about this tonight because it helped me get my cleaning goal done today. And just now i needed to wash my face before bed, and i told myself ill just do the quick version without applying all the fancy layers and whatnot that ive been experimenting with. But when i started washing my face i thought ""oh i should just do my entire routine, i feel up to it now that im here"" and i had to stop myself because i know if i did that i would have trouble motivating myself in the future when im even more exhausted than i was tonight.
Just some food for thought. I was musing over it and thought I'd share and see what you guys think of this method.."

12570,bipolar,Abilify Nausea,"Hello, all. I’m freshly diagnosed with bipolar 2, and the first medication my doctor prescribed is Abilify, 10mg. I know that some people say there are awful side effects, some say it works amazingly for them. Too soon to tell for me obviously but my question for anyone who has taken it: does the nausea when first starting it subside? It’s currently 2 in the morning, and I just woke up in what i can only describe as a hot flash? I had to run to the bathroom and puke. (Sorry for the TMI) I took it before bed, expecting it to knock me out, since it’s the first time I’ve taken it, but I laid in bed nauseous for several hours. I’ve never taken any antipsychotic medicine before. I hardly ever take more than an Advil so it’s a little scary and new to me I guess."

I’ve been taking lamotrigine for about a month and tapering it to 200mg I find that is helping me a lot. Way better than anti-depressants alone ever did. Mood is more stable and and I can control the ruminating thoughts betters. However, It seems like my sex drive has increased since a bit since I’ve been on it. Other meds tended to decrease it. The only resources I found online was around epilepsy with the med increasing sex drive. Has anyone else experiences this? Is it normal for some people taking it?  

I’m also on Prozac which always, as all other antidepressants I took decrease it."

I have always had very distinctive textbook manic and depressive episodes, even though a lot of time my mania manifests with anger and irritability. As of late, I have been really depressed, more depressed than I've ever been, but at the same time I have manic symptoms as well, not sleeping, impulsive decisions, irritability, etc. Does this happen to anyone else?

I hate her so much but I love her just a little less than I hate her.

On top of all that my kids are mistreated and call me crying because x's family is horrible. My young children have watched their grandfather beg for Jesus to save him. The thought of the fear he feels is gratifying. Ive been close many times and was never a bitch about it.

I am rage.

Sorry. Need to talk. Its more than that. My son is struggling in school. He works well and learns from me. She won't allow it 90% of the time.

I feel like I can never get a balance and because of it I really have no idea which direction I want my life to go in, I don't plan ahead because I think I would have killed myself by then but then I do make it to that point in my life and I end up feeling lost.

12576,bipolar,Fishy Psychiatrist,"I got a consultation last week by a psychiatrist to talk about possible treatment options for bipolar II. Overall, I thought (emphasis on THOUGHT ) the talk went really well. At the end of it, her and another psychiatrist recommended that I start on lamictal and go see a therapist. Because it was just a consultation, I'd need to go see my primary care doctor in order to get my prescription for lamictal. So, I went to see him the following week. 

As soon as he sits down with me, he starts reading some of the report and it was very fishy right off the bat, so I called the medical records department after the appointment to see what the psychiatrist wrote. Come to find out, she wrote a whole bunch of things which I never said in conversation e.g. my mother was ""emotionally abusive"" (not true) and that I ""wasn't close to my step father"" (also not true) and a bunch of other things that ultimately just raised a TON of red flags. I told my parents about what she wrote and now they're both pissed at me (and slightly emotionally devastated) because they think I said those things to the psychiatrist, when in reality all I told her was that my parents loved and supported me, but didn't know how to handle my mental illness (which I don't blame them for. I often wonder how tf the people in my life handle being around me AT ALL). 

So, I'm not going to take the lamictal. Fuck that. I took meds when I was younger, prescribed by another psychiatrist who also didn't listen to me and my needs and it ended in a psychotic break that lasted 12 hours and put me in the hospital. I'm still going to see a therapist as I think that would be beneficial for me. But in terms of meds? I don't ever think I'll be able to trust a psychiatrist enough again for those.

Sorry about the rant. I'm under a lot of stress now due to work, my mental health and now my family, and I just really needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading."

I’m just annoyed and sad at this point. And my baby daddy keeps waking me for frivolous shit like to move from the couch, but it’s fuckin me up. Idk. I’m making myself more mad again. I just wanna feel okay during sleep time. And I don’t wanna have to take drugs."

I’m just curious on what exactly goes on? I know I’m not supposed to drink with it, but I’m kinda an idiot who doesn’t listen sometimes. I think this will snap me out of though... apparently I was quite the spectacle (I hate I can’t remember any of it)."

12591,bipolar,Have any of y'all experienced weird sensations in your arms or wrists?,"TL;DR have you ever felt weird sensations in your arms and was it related to mania or anything else for you?

I've been taking Lamictal for many years and my doc has had me swap it out recently. It's been a med change from hell but I think I'm out from the worst of it. My depression is still pretty severe tho and I'm having this feeling I've had before in my arms and wrists like there's something crawling in there. Sometimes it's like they're burning with this feeling. 

It's something I've had many times before and has been heavily linked to my self harm issues. (TW) I'm not sure which came first but the urge it sends is like I need to let the feeling out by cutting open my skin. I know that's irrational and I've resisted successfully this time but that's where my mind goes. 

All this rambling is to ask if any of y'all have experienced that and if it seems to be mania related. I think it's gone along with mania for me but my episodes are usually mixed so I can't be sure. Obvs everyone is different but I'm just curious if this is something others experience."

I have 7 of the 9 BPD symptoms but they don't all manifest in ways that would be more commonly seen in the disorder. I also haven't had a chance to delve into it much deeper because my Therapist ghosted me and I haven't gotten up the nerve to start looking for another.

13866,bipolar,Maintaining long-term goals,"TL;DR How to maintain motivation with a hobby/interest over the course of a bipolar cycle

I was wondering if you some of you more seasoned guys might have some advice for some freshly diagnosed and trying to grapple this disorder.

I got recently diagnosed with Bipolar-II disorder, this follows my diagnosis with autism a couple years ago. The way these two can interact can be complicated but hopefully extricable. The problem I have is maintaining long term goals through the ups and downs of mood as well as obsessions caused by autism. 

The pattern I've noticed in myself is that as I'm entering an ""up phase"" of my Bipolar-II I often end up gaining a sharp obsession with some 'thing', usually a period of history, a culture, a language or a field of a study. The hypomania usually intensifies the obsession more and it can direct my manic energy towards it. For example at one point I got obsessed with the French Revolution and ended up buying 3 books on it and watching endless documentaries on it but then as the mania subsided I suddenly lost my motivation for those activities which precipitated the loss of the obsession. In rational reflection I do want to persist with some activities like learning a language but it seems my ability to keep up those interests never survives the rise and fall of my hypomania into depression. I imagine other people might have this problem too and I'm so wondering what strategies you guys have developed to deal with this problem. Sorry for the long post :L"

I’ve had a few severe depressive episodes with suicidal thoughts/plans since I’ve been off my meds.

Now that I’m in nursing school... well I really don’t have time for all that depression nonsense, ya know?"
13874,bipolar,I’m feeling confused about how I’m feeling... is it possible that I suddenly don’t have bipolar disorder anymore?,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II a few years ago, and I experienced the untreated symptoms for about 4-5ish years before that. I took medication for it and went to therapy and I began to feel a sense of “normal”. I feel like my episodes were more under control and at some points I even felt like I was cured and didn’t have bipolar disorder anymore! But if I forgot to take my medication, I was plunged into a deep depression so obviously I wasn’t “cured”. 

But earlier this year I stopped taking my medication. It started around March when quarantine first started, I began spending most if not all days at home. I would genuinely forget to take my medication because my routine got so messed up. But then when I realized I hadn’t been taking my medication, I kinda just kept not taking it. I don’t really know why. But I didn’t dive straight into my usual depression. Instead, I think I actually became manic (I’m just now realizing this as I type this out). I’m actually not sure if this is mania or not, but I became obsessed with playing this video game to the point where I didn’t sleep and I didn’t attend my classes on Zoom, and I had to drop all my classes because I was so behind. I was still seeing my therapist at the time and just told her I dropped the classes because I couldn’t adjust to remote learning, which is partially true.

Then the depression hit, and it hit hard. The video game I was so obsessed with and all the friends I made on it just didn’t bring me joy anymore. Nothing did. I spent a lot of time in bed and crying. My boyfriend at the time ended up breaking up with me, and I think it was a combination of me not giving him attention because I was so obsessed with the game and the following depression being too much for him. 

A few weeks later though, that depression kinda went away?? I say “kinda” because there were still days that were off, but it wasn’t a crippling depression like it was before.

Last month I ended up ghosting my therapist. She didn’t seem too bothered by it because I guess for the two or so months beforehand we didn’t really talk about anything worthwhile. Maybe she thought I was doing okay on my own? Who knows. 

I’m confused because I feel...normal? More or less? Despite not being medicated and not talking to my therapist. Like I don’t feel extremely happy or productive like I did when I was manic nor do I feel the same deep, crippling depression I felt before. But it’s just so hard to gauge what’s normal and what’s not because of this whole quarantine and staying at home and being out of school. For example, sometimes I’ll stay up for 30+ hours at a time and not feel the need to sleep and sometimes I’ll sleep endlessly and not get out of bed. But this is probably because I have no structure in my life right now so my sleep schedule is wack, right? And I’m not having any recurring negative thoughts per se, it kinda just feels like....nothing. Like I don’t have any real feelings at all. But I’ll still laugh if I’m joking with friends or watching something funny.

I don’t know... I’m beginning to wonder if I ever had bipolar disorder at all? Was I just being overdramatic and lazy? Or did I previously have bipolar disorder and it somehow just went away? Or am I experiencing an episode without realizing it because it’s being presented in a way that I haven’t experienced before?

If you read all this, thank you. I’ve been feeling very alone and being able to write this all out was cathartic. If anyone has any insight from their own experiences and could help me understand what’s happening that would be very appreciated!! If you need me to clarify anything just ask. Thank you again &lt;3"

Before her psychotic episode she was addicted to pot. She lost all interest in it while manic. But now that shes depressed she thinking of going back to it. Is that a good idea? I know once she starts it will be impossible to stop until another manic episode.

She sleep a lot now and has no motivation and no joy.

13883,bipolar,Need advice on how to be a good gf while my boyfriend deals with depression.,"My bf has recently gone from a manic state and into depression; hes got the weight of the world on his shoulders trying to be a good father- although his time with his daughter is limited; working extremely long hours at a job that doesn't appreciate him; and we just got off of a pretty rocky road during his mania primarily due to my insecurities. I struggle because my personality is ""fixer"" and I want to fix this problem; im realizing that I can't ""fix"" any of the issues he's dealing with and I  just need to love him where he's is.

I am looking for practical ways to show him love and support as he battles this without being overbearing.

When manic hes Mr. I can take over the world hes the most talented human I have ever met and we would play music together and go out on lots of adventures; he almost gets lost in music he creates and has hope about where he can go with his talents ... its amazing.  When depressed he self isolates and loses interest in music which is heartbreaking because of how TRULY MAGICAL seeing him on fire and confident in himself and his talent really is. 

I want to show him support by being there.... but i know that he needs time to reflect and be by himself. I want to gauge this conversation with him but I know with his state of mind right now is not the appropriate time and i dont want to overwhelm him or make him think i have any doubts about us....
 We are soooo opposite and I realize the ways I would want to be treated in a state of depression is not the way he would appreciate at all

I guess my question is to those who deal with heavy depressive cycles and are introverted.... what are ways to show love and appreciation without being too much.

13886,bipolar,I am immune to tornados. . .,"I mean, maybe?

I don't know if anybody else treads this line like I do, and I'm interested in hearing from others of our ilk.  I'm suicidal at the best of times, and it makes me think and say some really silly shit sometimes.

I care nothing for my life.  I know how that sounds, but it's not how you think.  It's not that I'm worthless, nor that I think death is the answer to all of life's problems.  It's just that I look at the possibility of death and DO NOT CARE.  If I got shanked to death right this moment, the only thing I'd be upset about is the painful shank wounds.

I think I've internalized this a bit, because I have a really strong feeling that I may have a superpower.  I am immune to tornados.  I've been IN several tornados in my life, including watching as one ripped a tree out of my neighbors yard about thirty feet from me, in the open, unprotected.  Never been hurt even a little.  And I revel in the idea so much that I walk and drive through massive storms and swirling tornados if and when it's necessary to get something done, like going home from work or getting a fountain soda from the corner store.  I simply don't care if I die, and the fact that I have done these things over and over and over and never been more than slightly inconvenienced when others within eyeshot are having their cars lifted into the air or siding torn from their houses makes me feel like the universe itself is trying to spite me and keep me here.

I've gotten a disease in the cartilage of my sternum so bad that it made me unable to use my arm.  Got better, didn't die.  SEVERELY allergic to certain (not sure exactly what) stinging bugs, and I've gone through anaphylactic shock a few times.  Never died from it.  Once, my SO accidentally spilled dinner all over my back and gave me severe second degree burns.  One of my co-workers described it as ""Freddy Krueger's face"".  Didn't get it treated, never even dressed the wounds.  Never got an infection and just, you know, got better.

It's always like that.  Things that would kill other people inconvenience me.  And after a while that shit gets to you, especially when the existential dread of death simply doesn't exist in me any more.

Anybody else feel that way?"

What I'm thinking is a particular ""con"" is the fact that we have children and bipolar has such a genetic component to it. At least I have an idea of what to look out for.

Going to the hospital at least once a month. I got so sick I had to call out, and they never called me back. Right after I landed a huge job for me, my first time managing. It was all fine until the other manager started butting heads with me and one of the cooks stole my wallet. Right after I started getting sick again. I had to quit, and spent a week at another job but had to leave there too. That was only three months ago. I just landed two more jobs and would be all set going forward, but I just found out I have three hernias. I felt this pain in December, and now all the sudden I feel it again. I can not even believe it. In those three months something happened with my doctor and he chose not to call me for the ""over the phone"" appointment. I just got over the worst of the withdrawals from Adderall, Xanax, and abilify. Then find out I am covered in hernias. I am stuck."
15191,bipolar,Prescribed Wellbutrin alone?,"I was diagnosed with bipolar illness because I experienced antidepressant induced mania after being prescribed the SSRI Citalopram for my initial complaints of anxiety and depression. To curb the mania, I was prescribed Seroquel (stopped due to blunting and weight gain) and then Abilify. At my recent appointment with my psychiatrist, I complained of akathisia and horrible anxiety from the Abilify. It was stopped cold turkey because I was in agony. I am depressed as hell post-mania but I cannot handle the side effects of those two mood stabilizers I was given. The psychiatrist said he will prescribe Wellbutrin alone at my next appointment if I still feel I am in a depressive state. He said it was an antidepressant that was less likely to cause shifts into mania. My question is, is this normal? Is Wellbutrin alone safe? 

I feel like everyone I read about is on Wellbutrin and a mood stabilizer. I am scared of becoming manic again, but I also fear the zombie-like effect of mood stabilizers so I was kind of intrigued by this psychiatrist wanting to prescribe it alone."

I have bipolar II and take an antipsychotic (specifically Seroquel) in addition to a couple other meds. What is this supposed to do for me? I've heard seroquel specifically can be good for depression, or did I make that up?

15201,bipolar,Is my husband skipping his medication?,"What I'm really trying to figure out is how common it is for someone who is bipolar and medicated to frequently go from: perfectly fine, medication is working great--&amp;gt; experiencing mood swings.

My husband has been living with bipolar disorder most of his life (around 15 years). It wasn't until 5 years ago that he was able to get himself to take treatment seriously and began regularly seeing a psychiatrist. Medication has been great and has considerably improved his condition, however he has yet to be stable for more than say 4-5 months. This is what the cycle looks like:

Stable, feeling great for a couple of months--&amp;gt;becomes slightly manic--&amp;gt;adjusts medication--&amp;gt;stable again for 1 month or more--becomes manic again (depression is under control for the most part)--&amp;gt; adjusts medication--&amp;gt;and on and on and on.

I feel like he isn't necessarily medication-resistant, since he does positively respond to the meds. But i don't understand why he fluctuates so frequently. Which is why I'm considering different possibilities....like is he just forgetting to take his medication consistently? Obviously no one can answer this question for me--but what I'm getting at is whether or not it is common for people to struggle this much with getting the right medication regimen for YEARS. It would be so helpful to hear about some of your experiences. Thank you!

Edit: I should have put this in the original post—a few of you have asked/suggested I ask him directly...I have! The issue—as many of you probably know—is that when he’s manic, he makes things up, of course not intentionally. But just genuinely believes something happened that never did. So though he tells me he’s taking it, I don’t know if I can believe that when he’s manic. Then when he’s back to normal, he doesn’t really remember things that happened during those episodes.

I also think this could be more of an issue of forgetting to take them, not necessarily skipping them on purpose. But hearing that others still experience mood swings even when being diligent about their meds tells me this could really just be part of what it means to live with this disorder, very helpful to know."

15209,bipolar,Diagnosis,"As far as I know you need to have manic/depression phases for at least 4 (some say 7) day in a row? So e.g. I need to be 1 week manic and the following 2 e.g. depressive?

The ones of you that are diagnosed with bipolar, are you really manic/depressive for several hours/days/weeks in a row?

For me I would have somthing like rapid bipolar or maybe just hard moodswings, dunno. At least I would say I am in general a bit depressive since 18 years now and if I am ""manic"" that is maybe idk some days of a week and can be several times a day. Especially if something really bad happend and I get more depressive, sometimes I even get suicidal thoughts, but after I calm down after some hours or the next day I get manic (?), like want to change my life and everything. 

E.g. I got diagnosed osteoporosis last year with 27 and it was for me like in 3 years I have to use wheel chair. So i got really sad for a couple of days. Then everything is ok and I get so fucking motivated, want to fix my mental health problems, eating disorder, work out, find friends all at one. Then after some days, my motivation is gone because of slow or none progress.. and I am back to my normal/depressive state that I have since 18 years. Similar things happens with dating/love problems or just if my internet browser crashes and I lose all my tabs. I would just want to die at that moment. Then the next day I am motivated and tell myself I will never ever open again more then 30 tabs, and it works. 2 weeks later again I have 500+ tabs open and in a few weeks the cycle repeats."

I just wanna be put out of my misery. This disorder fucking sucks."
16533,bipolar,How long do hypo manic episodes last?,"I’m 17 and I was diagnosed with bipolar around 9 months ago after a pretty intense manic episode. since then I’ve had one or two hypo manic episodes, but my most recent one lasted over a month and the only reason it ended was because I upped my meds, is it normal for them to last that long? Because I thought hypo mania only lasted a week or two, which made me think maybe I was bordering on going back into full blown mania but the episode never really felt like it got intense enough for me to consider it as such, Does anyone have any thoughts on this?"
16534,bipolar,Shouldn't I accept that this is all there is?,"Does anyone else feel like you should accept that this is your life and, yes, it's a complete mess but as if living differently from this sounds weird, even impossible... Like, how come other people do that? And how come I feel like I can't do the same, even with the medication? 

I mean, I was 'officially' diagnosed in 2016 but everytime I went to a new psychiatrist (either with my mother or by myself) I had to talk about my life and well, this is me, I have always been like this, I'm flawed, my relationships with friends, lovers, family and so on have always been messy, things were never easy for me due to the mood swings but I never thought of all this as ""bad"" or as problem. I've taken lots of different meds because at first I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression only, until my mother brought up the hypomania stuff that I didn't even know were actually a stuff, you know? I thought it was just me having a good time and now I don't even know anymore. And I cannot tell if the meds I am taking at the moment (Depakote &amp; Seroquel) are helping or not, I'm just having a hard time for weeks now and my mind doesn't. stop. thinking. ughh sorry I really needed to put it all out because sometimes I feel like these thoughts are about to eat my brain and it's hard to not have anyone who truly understands the whole situation to talk to. I hope this is the place for that. 

Also, I'd like to hear from you about the changes you felt on your daily life due to the medication. I think I never reached a stable level on that and maybe that's the reason why I feel so frustrated at times, I don't know much what to expect from it."
16535,bipolar,big mood swings multiple times a day,"hey friends- i was diagnosed w bp II earlier this year and i’ve been on lamictal for it (titrated up to 100mg over the last four or so months)
i’m beginning to think i may have been misdiagnosed- my mood swings happen frequently, sometimes multiple times a day, big drastic changes: from euphoric to calm to inconsolable to despondent to content to devastated. does this happen to anyone else? i find it’s much too random to chart, therefore can’t identify like, big long stretches of depression or mania like what i understand to be a classic bipolar persons experience... 
it’s really hard to navigate and i don’t think the lamictal is helping. my spirals aren’t getting better and still happen multiple times a week. i just don’t really know what to do, and can’t ever get my psychiatrist on the phone (f’ing kaiser)
if anyone has any words of wisdom about experiencing similar things, or specific meds that have helped, or literature to pass on.. literally anything. just looking for some help and direction and solace.
thanks so much."
16536,bipolar,I’m wrong a lot of the time and I am okay with it.,"I used to be super sharp but that was mostly due to my hypomania. Right before I was diagnosed I was mostly hypomanic or mixed, with little sprinkles of mania and depression. 

I also was extremely witty and charming and I loved it at that time that I even started identifying my personality with it. People loved it too, mostly strangers. My friends, not so much. 

Fast forward to now that I am medicated and leveled, I am noticing myself becoming a little slower that how I thought I was before. I forget words (English is also not my first language so I have another excuse), I mix up facts and say the wrong things, or I just sometimes don’t understand. 

I am okay with it. 

I’ve also noticed that I am not as confident as I used to be to a point that I become unsure of who and what I’m supposed to be. I attributed my entire being during my early 20s to my hypomania but now that that’s gone I’m having to rediscover myself. 

I am okay with it. 

Yesterday, I made a lot of mistakes and doubted myself quite a lot and was unsure of my interactions with others. But it was the first time I didn’t hate myself for it. I wasn’t as sensitive as I used to be. I wasn’t as defensive as I used to be. I wasn’t as aggressive as I used to be. 

And I am very okay with all of it. I like me now the healthy amount."

16538,bipolar,Bipolar 1 and ADHD - Psych won't medicate the ADHD,"Hi all.

I got diagnosed with both about 2 years ago and as you know getting in to a psych doctor takes FOREVER and both of them that I have seen so far have been entirely unhelpful and horrible on so many levels.   Just getting to the point where I can make appointments (and keep them) is hard enough but it has been an unmitigated disaster.  The first one I saw tried to medicate me for GAD (this was before I was officially diagnosed) and the second wouldn't put me on ADHD meds because of possible mania.  I am also fairly certain I have an eating disorder as well so the thought of going on mood stabilizers and gaining 40 pounds in a couple of months is an absolute nightmare to me.  

I am going to see my regular doctor today and going to see if he will put me back on Wellbutrin (was on it before) and apparently according to some research I have done that can help with ADHD as well.  I'm just stressed out sooooo badly between my two kids starting remote learning, money issues, not having a job right now and taking care of my elderly father that I am not dealing well.  

Any recommendations on meds that A) don't cause weight gain B) can help both bipolar and ADHD and C) how the hell to get my doctor to help me and listen to my concerns!  

Sorry for the rambling.  I am just so stressed and I was just starting to get my mental health back on track with exercise and a regular routine but I can feel it just totally going off the deep end again.  TIA!"
16539,bipolar,I am so sick of being bipolar.,"This is going to have triggers. I need to vent but a diary won't do. I need to know it's out there. 

I successfully pushed away the only person that I love and that makes me happy. The stupid thing was I thought I was being level headed about it and I hate myself now. I hate my brain. 

I have finally decided to go back on Lamictal because my moods are out of control and wreaking havoc as per usual but covid and feeling trapped in limbo has really been rough for me. I do this. I think I'm making a situation better but I always make it worse. 

I had the feeling my bf was getting fed up with my swings. I have been extra sensitive and I haven't been able to feel love. I know I'm probably frustrating but I feel like I give him every good thing I have in me. I was feeling like he was seperating from me and I didn't want to freak out. I didn't want to cling. I asked if we should take a couple weeks off until my meds balance. Lamictal takes sooooo long to work up to a therapuetic dose. I though he would feel relieved because I don't know what I thought. 

He doesn't want some time, he would rather just have all the time away from me. I lost him and I was only trying to keep him. It wouldn't even matter if he changed his mind because I already know I'm a burden and he would only be changing it out of guilt. I push everyone that loves me away because I hate myself so much that I don't trust people that love me. 

I thought things were great when I'm stable and I thought he loved me enough for when they weren't. I'm so lost and that neon light that always flashes suicide in the back of my brain is starting to flash brighter. It's becoming larger and the words are no longer blurry but crystal clear. The inevitable. I always keep it on the shelf for when times get bad Knowing their is a way out used to bring me peace. I know I need to give the meds a chance. I know it won't happen overnight.

I'm so tired of myself."
16540,bipolar,Coming off Vyvance the same month my masters dissertation is due,"A bit of back story: I (25F) live with comorbid BD-II and ADHD, so I've been taking Vyvance (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) for around 1.5 years, alongside an antidepressant (Wellbutrin) and mood stabiliser (Lamictal).

At the beginning of June I spoke with my psychiatrist about my desire to wean off Vyvance because: i) my insurance is going to change in December and I won't be able to afford it, ii) I am an American living in the UK and my psychiatrist is based in the US, so I can't get it refilled here, and iii) I study cognitive and clinical neuroscience, so I'm extremely concerned about amphetamine dependence since its long-term effects on the brain aren't comprehensively understood. My psychiatrist instructed me to taper off the Vyvance over the course of 3 months, dropping by 10mg each month so that when I ran out of Vyvance in September, I wouldn't need to return to the US to refill a controlled substance medication that I could no longer afford.

Here’s the issue. This summer constituted the final months of my masters programme, during which I was supposed to be writing my dissertation due for submission on 3 September. However, due to the **MASSIVE** drop in mood, energy and motivation I experienced when I began tapering off the Vyvanse (and partially due to my ADHD) I left approximately 90% my dissertation writing until August, one month before submission (I know, bad. Very very bad. I did this to myself). Essentially, the last few months of depression have been kicking my ass. Over the past two weeks, I've been forcibly kicking myself into gear trying to get the damn thing done.

Due to my uni’s COVID-19 face-to-face testing restrictions, my supervisor and I decided in June to incorporate simulated datasets in order for me to complete my research. However, this was dependent upon my supervisor coding, producing and providing me with the data I needed. Long story short, I just received the data today. Less than a week before the submission deadline. To quell my obvious panic, my supervisor assisted me in getting a deadline extension to the 24th of September. So, fantastic right? I now have another month to save my ass and produce a kick ass 15,000-word research paper. But then I remembered the Vyvanse.

Fuck. Me. I am set to run out of Vyvanse two days after the initial submission date of my dissertation. So now, even though I have an extra month to complete my paper, I'm freaking out. 

Every time I've decreased my dose while tapering, I've experienced all the adverse withdrawal effects. I was well aware it'd absolutely suck coming off it completely when the time came (I’ve done it before), but I also knew I'd be able to cope since the stress of my dissertation would be done.

But now? Now I have one week till I'm out of Vyvance, followed by 3 weeks of gruelling work to get my dissertation submitted on time. Honestly, I’m scared as fuck. Especially considering my brain is *currently* struggling to get the bare minimum amount of work completed each day. Working from home due to COVID has only exacerbated this issue, as I seriously struggle to concentrate when working from home.

So how on earth am I going to cope with the brain fog, spaciness, fatigue, inability to concentrate, and complete and utter lack of motivation that will hit during the final weeks of completing my precariously procrastinated paper? I can't even use my passion for the subject (neuropsychological effects of psychostimulants in the BD population, funnily enough) to drive myself at this point, as weaning off Vyvance has resulted in a complete and utter lack of interest in pretty much everything. 

Has anyone else had to deal with psychiatric medication withdrawals during a particularly busy time at work/in university? How did you manage to focus and motivate yourself? What were your coping strategies? Any sort of advice is welcome (and much needed). Many thanks."

16542,bipolar,How common is hypomania?,"It feels like nearly every therapy session I have my therapist asking if I feel like I’m hypomanic or manic. I can tell (other people will notice it) when I’m truly manic but hypomania is more difficult for me to see. I’m on lithium and have been good on taking it. 

This week was a bit chaotic because of external things and I feel like I reacted pretty normally to it not really. Only thing different is that I cut my hair but I always cut my hair have been for years so its normal for me. I told her that the week was a little rocky because of external factors. I didn’t really think that I was too hypomanic. I got an email after that she is recommending I see my psychiatrist again perhaps if I need a change in meds in a couple days. But I saw him two days ago and he was comfortable in seeing me in a month from now. 

Sometimes I just feel like my therapist is always assuming or asking if I’m hypomanic when I personally don’t feel like I am. I think I’ve been seeing her for about three months and she’s asked me on several occasions. So I’m just wondering how often is hypomania? Or for any tips on seeing if I am hypomanic?"

I've always had the ""kill switch "" talk with myself for what is Too Far before things are too terrible and I need to off myself and so many parts are checked and I have such a hard time seeing what the damn point of going on it. I'm sorry this post is so panicky I just. Im so lonely and scared and tired and can't get out of bed but can't sleep because I'm scared and I feel like such an exhausting burden"
16547,bipolar,1 month of stability!,My psychiatrist upped my dosage of vraylar from 3 mg to 4.5 mg a month and a half ago and I’ve now been stable for an entire month. The medicine actually worked! I feel so blessed.
16548,bipolar,I’ve tried almost all the medications and they don’t work.,"I’m currently on risperidone and Wellbutrin and it’s going terribly. Pretty sure I’m more moody than I was while I was unmedicated. I think the only drugs I haven’t tried yet are Latuda or Abilify, but at this point I hate antipsychotics so much for what they’ve done to me and I don’t know if I can try again. 

But what’s the alternative? I’ve tried to be unmedicated. I tried so hard and I was so unstable. So I’m miserable on pills and off them. I feel so trapped and I really hate this disease. 

Please if anyone has a story about it taking a really long time to find the right meds, share with me and give me some hope that maybe Latuda or Abilify might make me better instead of worse."

16550,bipolar,"Urgent: (TW: S, SH, SA) Doctors want to discharge me from mental health hospital despite me knowing I am not ready to. Urgent Advice needed","Hey guys,

I am writing this in need of urgent advice.
Bassicaly I am currently going througha servere depressive phase which has ultimately landed me in a mental health hospital over here in australia. Now at first this place was amazing, they took my requests and concerns seriously, they looked over my medication and adjusted it to help me (moved from lamotrigine to lithium and upped my dose of quetiapine). Anyway things were going well however my mood has not changed one bit. I was originally admitted due to a suicide attempt which luckily (or unluckily depending what time of day you ask me) failed, and at first they took that seriously. Now I have been here for 7 days and they are telling me I will be getting discharged on stairway despite me still being suicidal and even practiced self harm in the unit with sharpened finger nails. Needless to say while it has been great that they have altered my medication. I just dont think I am in a safe enough mindset (as stated earlier still very much suicidal and have the desire to self harm) to go home right now, esspecially seeing that my home life was one of the triggers that led me to become this bad mentally. 

Ontop of that, everyone but this one doctor (the one who is incharge of admissions) has been telling me that they beleivw i need significant help and that they expect me to be here a while to the point where i was offered a bed in the long term (1 month +) unit which at the time i declined as it would involve me sharing a room with a stranger which due to a previous sexual assualt case, I did not feel comfortable with and I knew there were single rooms at the same unit.

So bassically my question is this, despite telling the admissions nurse that I don't feel safe going home at this stage, she believes (against all the other nurses opinions might i add) that I am well enough to be discharged. 

How do i make it clear that I do not feel safe enough mentally to go home, so that i can receive further treatment in a safe environment. I know at this stage if I go home, i will self harm to a extreme extent, and i will attempt suicide. Yet the nurse does not belive me. So what do i do. I have been nothing but open with the nurses so far about my mental health issues, have been open about trying new therapy and medications and i have defintly not been a problematic patient.  so I fail to see the reasoning of why 2 days ago they were willing to offer me a bed in the longer stay word and now despite probably deteriorating in mental health even further since i was admitted, they suddenly think I am all good to go home. 

I am genuinely concerned for my own life here, I can say now that I wont kill myself (because this place is more than safety proffed) however my mental health is at such a low point that If I had the ability to do it now I would and without getting g the help I was expecting to get in here. That won't change by the time I am being discharged."
16551,bipolar,Bipolar Marines,They've got to exist right? Are there any bipolar Marines on here or does anyone know a Marine who is bipolar? I'd like to hear their advice on how to manage this illness. The training they (ones with bipolar) receive coupled with their already unique approach to life has got to be something to hear. I'm gonna look into this more. I don't even wanna be a marine. I just wanna know how a bipolar Marine does it.
16552,bipolar,Lithium and Insomnia,"Hi 
So my psychiatrist is not super big on diagnosing things, especially bc I’m so young. He never explicitly said I’m bipolar so I’m not sure. But I went to him because I had a ‘hypomanic episode’ as he described it. And complained about insomnia and irritability. 
I’ve been on a few drugs for insomnia and they aren’t working so he prescribed lithium to help both with the irritability and ‘hypomania’ but I’m not sure if it will help with my isnomnia on normal/or depressed phases. 
Any advice helps or if I’m not in the right place please direct me to another sub. Thx"
16553,bipolar,Birthdays with bipolar.,"Today is my birthday, my 22nd. This time last year I had quit my nice job and spent all my savings on a road trip with my boyfriend. We were on the road for a month, sleeping out of our car to make it possible to see as much as we could. We traveled all the way up the west coast into Canada. I had the best time of my life, and the consequences I had to face when I got home didn’t even matter. I didn’t care that I couldn’t pay my rent or afford food, because on that trip last summer, I felt more alive than I ever have. This year, I’m alone. There seems to be just a small fraction of people left that care to wish me a happy birthday this year. I haven’t held a job since I quit mine last summer. My anxiety and paranoia has skyrocketed. I miss my hypomanic haze from last year... from every summer before this one. I look so forward to the summer, when I can feel alive again. But this year, it’s felt like winter never ended. My birthday is just a suffocating reminder of a summer passed and another year older, having not made it anywhere in life in the past year. I’m getting older, and feeling more and more helpless and pathetic."

17903,bipolar,Quitting Lamictal/Lamotrigine (memory loss),"I’m 22 years old and have been on lamictal for just shy of 2 years. I have been taking 300mg XR for a year. There are a lot of people asking on different forums about lamictal causing memory loss and speech problems, many people say to stop taking the drug. While there’s no scientific evidence, here’s my experience and why I’m stopping:


In the beginning you will feel a mind fog that progressively gets stronger until about 4-6 months in. Each dosage increase brings you further in the fog until you assimilate and completely forget your previous consciousness. I originally felt that this was amazing because my brain was numb and I wasn’t so angry/depressed/compulsive. I began to notice memory loss around 3 months in by recognizing that I never recalled the previous day. Before the drug, I would obsess about certain instances and experience psychosis. The first indication is not being able to remember if you took your daily medication even if you take it every morning as soon you wake up. This progresses until memory loss doesn’t feel like memory loss anymore because the lack of retention is now a part of your reality. 


Be very careful with drug interactions. Don’t take methamphetamines like adderall or vyvanse, you will become manic. Don’t drink more than a beer or two, but try not to drink at all bc it will make you blackout &amp; act psychotic. Don’t take mdma, you don’t experience the depression comedown like you normally would—instead you feel stupid happy for a couple weeks and act psychotic. On the bright side lamictal made me quit smoking weed. I was a hardcore stoner and all of a sudden I hated it and became paranoid. 

**tl:dr** overall, don’t start lamictal unless you are really experiencing mental agony. Try to get off it ASAP after those feelings subside."
17904,bipolar,the voices are telling me to stop fighting them and to just ride. what even IS stability?,"i’ve been hearing this for awhile now
to just take my meds and let what happens happen
to stop fighting it, to make peace with it and accept my mind for what it is

what even is stability??? how do you even know when you have reached stability??

i’ve been in therapy since i was in 4th grade and now i’m nearly 23 years old

i’m tired of trying to be like” everyone else” when i’m not neuro-typical so why keep trying to be? even those without this illness mostly aren’t “stable”

i have bipolar disorder and have experienced what seems to be never-ending trauma. i’m physically disabled as well.

i’ve been rapid cycling for as long as i can remember and nothing stops it from happening

meds make it less severe, so i’ll keep taking them, but there’s no cure so i think my expectations need to be adjusted

i can just pretend i’m less psychotic to keep my dosage the same without having to relive all the things that are terrible by talking about it

(writing this while manic and “Play Date” by Melanie Martinez has been playing for hours and i have a dr’s appt in 5 hours)"
17905,bipolar,How to seperate bipolar from ADD and BPD?,"Im headed towards a bipolar 2 diagnosis but i share a lot symptoms with the other two.  How does one separate these three? 

I have a long list of symtpoms. Irritability, insomnia, emotional dysregulation, emotions going from 1 to 100 or apathy,  attention and focus problems (hyperfocusing and spacing out), memory problems, anxiety, random intense feelings of boredom that turn into aggression if no outlet, impulsive and reckless actions (generally when feeling higher energy, bad, or bored), paranoia (believing people secretly dislike me and talk about me behind my back, etc),major depression, jealousy, controllingness, intrusive thoughts and racing thoughts that worsen with romantic relationships and under stress (for instance, ill just have a random thought of ""oh what if he likes his ex gf more than me"" and then an inability to self soothe and ill have to go berate with questions to fix it. Now this happening like multiple times a day or multiple times a week). Codependency- the more attached to someone I get, the more crazy I turn. Lack of energy and inability to complete simple things, chores, etc. Also when im realllly angry, ill start shaking uncontrollably and will yell and dont care about my safety (for instance, threw something that was glass and cut myself on it and had to be restrained until I calmed down). I'll go weeks without messaging friends to then sending them 10 double messages rambling.

I'm getting really frustrated with trying to figure out this mystery diagnosis"
17906,bipolar,Trileptal muscle spasms,"Hello! I got my diagnosis 2 weeks ago after being apparently misdiagnosed for the last 22 years. I had terrible effects the first 4 days but realized it was an interaction between zyrtec and my 75 mg starter dose of trileptal. The last 3 days (day 11-14) I’ve had crazy twitching in my right ring finger and now my legs are shaky and the muscle under my arm fat is twitching. I have an appt with my primary care doctor tomorrow, but I want to make sure that the “increased seizures” side effect applies only to people with a history of seizure before I drive my three kids to a sitter and myself to the doctor. Any other insight on how serious this side effect is would also be appreciated! Thanks so much."
17907,bipolar,Does being home alone trigger your depression/mood swings?,"So with the pandemic I've been working from home a lot more. In fact, I now only go into the office on Monday's and Wednesdays. Fridays my wife works from home as well.  


That leaves me totally home alone for 8 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays and it's been really rough. Those are my worst days of the week. My mood swings dramatically throughout the day and my depression is more likely to flair up. I was wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience and if they found anything to help with it.

EDIT:
Thanks for all of your help and support! It's encouraging to know I'm not alone and you have all given me good advice on how to cope. I'm new here but I already appreciate this community a lot"
17908,bipolar,Bipolar rage,"Hello everyone.

I was diagnosed with bipolar II back in November after a hypomanic episode followed by a major depressive episode. 

I finally decided to seek treatment for it when I was going through that depressive episode. I do CBT every two weeks or so and I take bupropion to help with mood stability. 

My question for everyone here is, do you ever feel so angry about things that end up not mattering in a few minutes or couple hours? I tend to fixate and have outbursts of anger over tiny things of things that generally would not bother me otherwise if I wasn't in an episode. 

What is everyone's experience with this? I feel very isolated because nobody I know has bipolar and I get little to no validation from friends and family because they think I'm just ""normal"". And whilst I do agree that everyone experiences emotions and goes through tough times, I wish I could just have them inside my head when things like this happen. It might not seem like a big deal to other people, but to me it makes me mad. I just wanna know that I'm not the only person who gets angry over small things or trivial things. Do you guys experience this in mania or in depressive episodes? I think mine tend to be more so when in slipping into a mixed or depressive state. 

I'm sorry if this was a rant all over the place, but I feel crazy most days and I wish I knew that there was other people experiencing what I feel on the inside and not just what I choose to show on the outside."
17909,bipolar,I know I’m not the only One fighting this. It just feels that way.,"I’m a 27 year old male that’s married and   
Has two kids. I was diagnosed with bipolar about 6 months ago, after a bout of deep depression that followed an extreme high that almost landed me divorced and broke. I have been taking medication since then. I don’t know how to identify when I’m about to have either episode. One minute I’m focused and my head is quite and the next I’m either going crazy or don’t want to get out of bed. I don’t know how to explain these things to my doctor. Plus when I try to talk to people they tell me they don’t see an issue because I’m so calm and collected. They tell me everyone has mood swings. But mine go 180 mph in either direction. I don’t know how to hold my demeanor together anymore. It feels like I’m being ripped apart in the inside. I don’t know who I am anymore and it feels like I can’t keep my realities in check. I don’t know if it’s because I have always held everything in or I just know how to fake everything. I know I have had issues but I’ve always go fought through them.  But either way I don’t know how much longer I can go doing this.  I feel like 2 different people and no one to talk to. My wife tried to understand but has a hard time because I’ve always been the provider and the strong one. I don’t usually let people into my head or give them ideas on what I’m doing but I need help. My main questions are, how do you live with this? How do people not doubt every thought they have?"
17910,bipolar,I'm regretting accepting my new job,"Hello everybody, so... After being unemployed since April I finally got a job and I should be happy but I'm not. It's the same field I have been working for some time but the company and the people are awful(not everyone of course but the majority are assholes). Not only they don't help, I have realized that some people give wrong information on porpoise, this was confirmed by someone that is working there for a few months now, so I'm not imagining it. I'm 34y/o and have been working since I was 16 and this place is already the 2nd worst place I've work in my life (it has been 2 weeks I'm there). I was supposed to have 3 weeks of formation but have been working alone since Monday. I was told the company had difficulties getting some one to do this particular job,  and they have even tried to put someone that was already an employee there but most people couldn't/didn't wanted to do it or were to slow for the job, this company has around 500 people. Now I see I should have seen that as a red flag... In my country you only get unemployment benefits if your contract has ended or if the company let you go bc they don't need you anymore and I signed a 2 year contract that I thought it was great bc due to the pandemic most places aren't giving more then 3 months contracts around here. When things seem to good to be true they usually are. On paper this job is perfect for me but I think I really need to start looking for a new one bc I don't know how long I can restraint my self and tell those people to go to hell."

17913,bipolar,Stigmatizing my own illness,"CW: stigmatization of bipolar.

Please don't read if you are sensitive to judgements of people who have bipolar.

I try really hard to view and talk about bipolar as simply an illness that lots of different kinds of people have and just need the tools to manage. But the truth is that I see myself and the others in my therapy group as fucked up people that nobody should ever want to date or, tragically, end up having as a parent. 

I see people doing bipolar awareness and suicide awareness stuff where they say all these things about how people who have bipolar are unjustly stigmatized. I wish that I believed the things they say and I constantly lie by pretending I do. But, while I agree that a lot of media misrepresents things, I still can't find a way to see people with my illness as being anything other than individuals who others should try really hard to keep out of their lives.  I hold no grudge against people who judge me for having bipolar because I think they're generally right about people like me.

I'm just wondering if there's anything that has helped anyone come to see things differently that they might share. I really want to say I believe all these things that advocates say, but I can't find a way to change the fact that I would never, ever want to be associated with anybody with my illness if I didn't have to be."

I can’t sort my thoughts. I can’t place one exact thought and think on that. I cycle through so many of them so fast it almost dizzy’s me in a psychological way. I feel all the emotions that come along with these plethora of thoughts and all at once. I can’t place what I’m feeling and the only way to describe it is as everything. I think it’s a big source of my anxiety. Its cycling through one emotion per second and my body doesn’t know how to handle it. I want to not constantly worry. I want to have one day free from paranoid/intrusive thoughts and not have to fight myself from believing them or convince myself that I’m being irrational. downplaying you’re own mind and it’s processes wears at you. multiple diagnoses, multiple meds, multiple therapists (three of whom left their treatment with me to the next and all from the same office) I don’t know what’s wrong with me, how can I be just depressed if sadness isn’t a constant ? Or just have anxiety when most of my anxiety is triggered by multiple emotions. what is wrong with me? what does it mean to feel everything all together and all at once. what is wrong. To put in simpler terms, I get out of bed everyday, I take care of myself, food is a vice but I’m not obese. I take my showers, actually one of the only things that help me. again, my mind is on go 24-7."

It’s been a year since my last manic episode, I’ve found the right med combination, and I no longer even think of the phrase “bipolar” in my everyday life. I know I have bipolar but I just stopped attaching myself to the belief that it’s part of my identity.

I also feel very muted and I’m not as happy or sad as I usually am. My therapist says I’m just very attached to my depressed identity and that it just means the meds are working. I will have things happen that usually make me really happy or really sad and I can’t even express it or cry when I’m depressed or feel happy and it feels like no one is listening to me. I can tell that I’m a bit sadder than usual but it just feels like high functioning depression, I’m not as happy and am losing interest in things but its not as intense as it usually it so I can still do the basic things I can like get out of bed, walk my dogs, and eat. I brought that up to my psychiatrist and he put me on Zoloft. He said it should help with the lower moods but I really don’t know if that’s what’s going to help me.

19295,bipolar,This is a rant? Idk. I need to write. Lol.,"I've been experiencing these symptoms since late teens. Diagnosed with Bipolar over a decade ago. 34 now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have found many medications that haven't worked for me. I have found some medications that work for a short period and then stop working. I have bounced from doctor to doctor. Usually losing my doctor either because I disappear for months at a time or I work up some deluded conspiracy theory they are secretly poisoning me or my insurance just drops me for no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a mania episode that lasted around 9 months. In which time I ruined my life in so many ways. I destroyed my body, lost two jobs, lost friends/family, spent $50k in someone else's savings, racked up $150k in debt (mostly medical,) and moved over 3k miles from my home and back.

&amp;#x200B;

2 years ago I had managed to get a new doctor/therapist combo and onto a set of medications that made the wave a little smaller so I wasn't hitting the absolute high/low points. Problem was as with all drugs I take, they start to lose their effects quite quickly. A year ago my meds failed and I slipped into a manic episode and I spent quite a bit of money that I just don't have. After I was off the high I went in and saw my doctor. She increased my dosage and we went on with our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

About 6-8 months ago I slipped again and started to cycle rapidly. I've been cycling once a week to every other week. It's just an up, increased sexual desire and no sleep for a week at a time, and then back down to rock bottom where I want with all my heart to put my gun to my head and pull the trigger but I don't have the energy to lift the heavy firearm.

&amp;#x200B;

About 3-4 months ago I stopped all medication and stopped contact with my prescriber after I had a reaction to a new medication she put me on and I accused her of trying to poison me. :( Really did like her though. I've had strained contact with my therapist, mostly due to Covid, but also because she is quitting her practice. I did have a couple really bad cycles this last month. A really bad high with over a week of no sleep. And then a really bad low where I nearly took my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what to do. This last week or so hasn't been bad. I hit the middle again. I can see with that I need help. I did talk to my therapist and she recommended the hospital. I went to my primary care doctor and well I ended up seeing a Nurse since he was on vacation. She didn't want to discuss any of those problems since I'm his patient. So I have an appointment with him Sep 14th.  


I've thought about the hospital more than once this last week. At the same time I'm scared to death of the thought of being somewhere I might never be allowed to leave. It's a deep fear of mine to be locked away. I know it doesn't sound rational, but the problem is I fear they won't let me go because I'm also suicidal. I have been my entire life. It's all I've ever known. To me it's always an answer to my problems if I decide to go down that path. I know I won't do it right now, I'm just not there right now. But I worry where I'll be in a week or two. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do believe I'm headed towards a manic episode though because I've been feeling an increase in my sex drive. It's like having a thirst that you can never quench. It's maddening. But it might mean I have a bit of extra time between now and my next depressive episode.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for reading my little rant. I just thought I might find people who can relate to how this can make one feel. Like you are on a roller coaster with no option to get off.

19297,bipolar,Early warning signs of Hypomania / Mania,"Just curious what your early warning signs of mania are. How do you know your entering mania or hypomania? 

Cause I’ve been dealing with a lot of depression lately and I’m in treatment right now. And even yesterday I had a big stressor come up that triggered a lot of anxiety, paranoia and depression. 

But today feels really fuckin different and amazing. I have a lot of energy and I just spent a few hundred dollars on nothing I needed this morning. I’m feeling kinda careless about treatment too. It feels like I’m going into hypomania but I don’t know at this point."
19299,bipolar,Seeking community for my brother with bipolar/schizophrenia,"My brother has struggled with bipolar schizoaffective disorder (the diagnoses have changed, and I’d say neither bipolar nor schizophrenia are quite accurate) for almost 10 years. He is 28 and was recently released from a weeklong hospitalization after over four days without sleep in full force mania and psychosis. This is the most recent of many hospitalizations and even more episodes over the years and it seems they are occurring more frequently as time goes on. He is constantly looking for people to connect to and struggles to relate to most people he meets in person or in outpatient groups. He is highly intelligent and normally a very kind, almost overly compassionate individual. His manic episodes tend to focus around books and obsessing over the connections between the books and the world and the struggles of people with mental illness. In an attempt to find meaning and belonging in this life, he has become dedicated to the idea of fixing/creating a new mental health system. While this is a noble cause and I believe he has the brilliance and drive to make an impact, my priority is his health and his life first. He does not have the stability or the support he needs in order to make meaningful progress in his worldly goals nor in his personal life.

On this note, I am searching for some type of community where he may have the opportunity to make meaningful connections. He needs access to people who want to talk (on the phone or over video chat, not online threads) about very intense topics all the time. He is not capable of enjoying day-to-day/normal conversation and dislikes engaging through humor. I am looking for something that would be with people near his age (late twenties – mid-thirties). How do I find people like this? How do I help facilitate connection? My family and I are desperate at this point, we don’t see a path for stabilization or meaning in his life if something doesn’t change.

We are potentially open to individuals who relate to his story, but more than anything we are looking for a community. With the pandemic, I thought there might be Zoom communities that meet regularly. While outpatient groups have not been successful for him, I am hoping that an online community has wider breadth and could offer a more curated group of people who are highly intelligent, closer to his age, and have similar life/mental health experiences. Meaningful, nonfamilial connections are such a huge part of what makes life worth living.

My family and I cannot be the only people who care deeply for him, it is not enough. He has so much to offer but has never found the people ready to receive and reciprocate. Any resources would be much appreciated. PMs are welcome if you’d like more information about his story. Thank you so much."

19302,bipolar,Am I bipolar? Or am I emotionally unstable? Are they the same thing or related? Lonely and struggling with major depression.,"Hi everyone, 

This will be my first time posting here, so I apologize if posts like these are not allowed.

I’m 28 M, socially awkward, I don’t have friends because I struggle to interact with people. I’m extremely close to my cousins, so they sorta serve as my best friends in a way. Anyway, I’m closeted, and have been struggling with my situation for a really long time. I’m not well off and have made some poor choices and basically depleted my savings, so I am in no way financially stable. I currently life with my parents who are homophobic/conservative, so I’m trying to rebuild my life so I can finally move out and eventually come out. 

My closeted situation has made me incredibly emotional. I’m lonely, all I want is to be with someone, but I can’t right now. I’ve just gotten around the fear of meeting up with guys and dating but the moment I was mentally ready, the pandemic hit. So I can’t even meet with people. 

I’ve been dealing with loneliness for my entire life. I work 40 hours a week and am a full time student trying to figure out where to go in life. My mind is scattered all the time, and it puts me in an extremely bad mood.

I’m in a really bad mood 75% of the time, so my family pretty much thinks I’m an asshole, the 25% I’m either normal or insanely happy. I’ve noticed lately I’ve been craving alcohol in a way I haven’t before. I used to indulge in it to have fun, but these days I sometimes feel I need it to feel happy. 

I think all my issues stem from me being closeted, but I just can’t come out right now. I have hundreds of family members and they’re all conservative/homophobic. I feel like I’m alone on an island. My social life sucks, living situation sucks, I hate my job, school is stressful. I struggle to get out of bed every morning and am late to work everyday. 

I’m extremely depressed and think about suicide all the time. I have trouble sleeping and depend on sleeping pills, alcohol, or weed to put me to sleep. I have a lot of regrets in life that I can’t seem to shake off. My mood goes up and down, and I sometimes fear one day in the future I’m going to kill myself. Idk what to do."
19303,bipolar,Just a little love rant about my friends,"I have been dealing with bipolar for as long as I can remember. My father was an abusive arsehole who destroyed my brain. It’s been hard but the one thing I have had, since Highschool, are just the best best best people as my friends. Like, I’m honestly shocked at how beautiful and wonderful they are. Any of them would drop everything to come and see me if I needed them, they help me with everything I need help with. My bumper came off in a little manic accident and I was having a lil freak out and Mia went straight to Bunnings, got cable ties and silicone glue and put it back on for me because I can’t afford a new bumper or car right now. If they can’t reach me in a day, they all contact each other and get someone to come check on me. Eds has left work to come pick me up when I was in a bad state, Lan has taken me to the hospital even tho she had a uni test the next morning, like my friends will always put me first if I’m in a bad state. I might not have a father but I have the greatest people on this planet who love me and they are the only reason I am still alive to this day. So I guess what I’m trying to say is, find good friends who genuinely care about you. It’s the best protective factor I have(except for my cat)
I would do anything for these people!
God I love them

She’s always complaining that I am wallowing too long or that I’m too anxious or too stressed and I need to learn to let it go. 

I agree that I need to work on my emotions and anxiety and mental health but I don’t think it’s fair for her to tell me how I’m supposed to feel. I’m working on myself but I don’t feel like I’m allowed to feel anything when I’m here and it makes me even more frustrated.

With another psychiatrist, I was already on lithium and it messed up my kidneys so I’m not taking that again so she told me my only medication options are lamictal, quetiapine, and ketamine, even with knowing that lamictal has adverse side effects that have reduced my quality of life. 

I don’t want quetiapine. I don’t want lamictal. I don’t want any of it, but she told me today I will always have to take medication and that I didn’t really have a choice. Although I was suicidal before today, there came a time today where I had the blade in my hand ready to do it. This can’t be life.

19312,bipolar,PLEASE help me help my best friend (ADVICE) XXL,"TW: Drug Use

Hi. Let me preface this by saying that I made similar posts in subs like r/Advice and r/relationship_advice but they obviously didn't deem this topic a worthy discussion. This is kinda my last resort since I hope you people are the most familiar with any of this. I wanted to flair this according to any trigger but I don't know how. If mods decide to change it, thats only fair.

This is about my best friend. Let's call him Sam (fake name).  Two years ago, he was diagnosed as bipolar. To put anything from my viewpoint into perspective, you should know I am on the spectrum and this story is subjective at best.

But let me start: I am worried. It all started 4 years ago, when I moved to a distant city after graduating. I was lonely and struggling and I was in contact with Sam sporadically but we weren't best friends yet, we only graduated together. Sam was desperate to leave the small city we grew up in and, being lonely and looking for a friend, I convinced him to move to my city, 200 miles away. I admit, this is partly why I feel responsible for him now. Because he did move and we became friends through that. We'd hang out every few days.

In the next two years, we both struggled. He worked in fast food since he didn't want to get in Uni right away and I lost my job in social services and decided to go to Uni where he eventually joined me. Thing was, he never showed up. He stayed at home, claiming it was too difficult for him to head out. Too stressful. He'd stay home and smoke Weed all day, a habit we shared, but one that eventually became the only thing he'd do.

Fast forward to now. I quit Uni two years ago because of burnout syndrome and left the city. He stayed. He is still living there while I took the last two years to recover. The thing is, he didn't. In our first year in Uni he got diagnosed, but nothing really changed. He still sits at home and smokes weed all day. His lifestyle is funded by his parents (I really can't blame them, he's their only child) but their resources are scarce.

Currently, I am trying to change my life completely and have thus considered ending our friendship. The last two years, nothing happened in his life and every single time I try to motivate change I'm running into a wall. His options are running low. I am more than worried, I love this guy but he's essentially letting destruction run its course and I feel more than helpless.

He's partly suicidal too and I know he needs therapy. But I can't give this friendship up yet. I know (and have already told him) that as soon as I finish my bachelor and moving on to my major, I simply have no space in life for him anymore. At least not his current, lethargic, jobless self.

He's pulling me down, he's negative about every aspect of my life, even though he did not use to be this way (i.e. my grandpa died this year and I wanted to quit smoking since he died of a heart attack as a heavy smoker. His words only were that I would fail that anyway. He's said similar about my relationships in the past but I know he doesn't mean it).

On a good day, I love him dearly, but even our other best friend is marrying next year, starting a family. The world is slowly moving on without him and I feel like the last part hanging on to him.

Maybe this is just a rant, but: can you help me? Do any of you have some advice."

19315,bipolar,Does anyone else get random intense feelings of shame and guilt?,"I, a few times a day, get hit with this feeling of intense shame and fear. I have panic disorder so it might be that, but I'm wondering if anyone else with bipolar disorder gets these sudden emotion flashes without cause."
19316,bipolar,I forgot I was bipolar,"I've been on my meds and been doing really well in comparison to before. I know if I miss my medication, I am far more anxious and irritable and depressed. But I've been doing really well and o ly missed maybe one or two days over the last 3 months. I genuinely forgot what it feels like to have mood swings or the extreme episodes.

I actually kinda miss it. I miss feeling so much, feeling so hard. I miss that raw feeling like cool air on a sunburn. I miss drowning in my feelings and just experiencing myself in every fiber of my being. I miss writhing in agony and elation, where everything was just too much all the time but it never was enough.

I kinda miss it. I feel like I'm doing so much better now. My life is changing and looking up, I'm going to college and plan to go to university. I got my first ever full time job. I'm doing well for myself. And no small thanks to my medication, I feel I can handle everything. But I want to feel, for just a few minutes, that everything is falling apart. I want to be able to scream and cry like I used to. Because I feel that pit in me, taped over with antidepressants and stabilizers. I feel that ma of loneliness and sadness and fear and for a minute I want to indulge in it. But I had a hard time doing that before the meds. With medication, I cant justify it at all. Because I can still go on. Even if I really dont want to."
19317,bipolar,"28 (m) nearly lost it all. But it had me learn that I am bipolar, and so much more.","Well. I have been off and on Prozac for much of my life. And the most recent round set off several episodes of mania. No one really noticed and neither did I. I run a commercial fishing boat in alaska in the summer, and dealt with mania all summer. Get done with the season and my fiance of 5 years decides to leave, a fear of my addictive personality. Nearly committed suicide: I was very very close. Nearly lost my small business. Scared for my life, I voluntarily admitted myself to a pychiatric hospital. It was one of the most profound experiences of my life; I felt safe and secure. I got prescribed lithium and gabapebtin and I must say, onto my 3rd week out of the hospital, and I feel better than ever. Im sober, absolutely no drinking or smoking Marijuana for me for quite awhile. I found my friends and family that I never thought could support or be there for me, checking in constantly. My racing thoughts are gone. I feel clear headed, like a breathe of fresh air. 
My story isn't over, it's just beginning. I have a new lease on life, im doing things that Ive want to do and are healthy for me. Going back to school for my 4th degree, picked up a new job, and ill be living on my fishing boat down here in Washington. Im learning to move forward, and accept myself. 
I'll be joining the semicolon tattoo club soon enough as a reminder. Ill also get anchor and an open delta symbol on each side. Ive always kept this identity of a fisherman, its who ive been, highly education with a masters degree, but still a fisherman. But rather than walk away from an industry I love, my story isnt over and there is much more. The open delta for im open to change and moving forward: there is more to me than just maintaining this identity of a fisherman. 
I'm happy where I am at, and ill always struggle with my mental health, but I do know I'm in the best situation than I have been in years."
19318,bipolar,"Unemployment, and trying not to transition to state dependency.","I'm super frustrated these days. I'm dealing with mental health struggles, diagnosed as everything from major depression and anxiety to bipolar II. I've been through seven or eight misc types of mental health professionals, over the course of years, and never really seen an improvement. Everything from ketamine to about 12-15 different medications. 

I lost my job at the start of covid, and my HR director told me it was mainly because of attitude. At the time, we had switched health care providers and I was not under anyone's care for medication management. My cousin died suddenly a week prior to me being fired. A week before that, I had been kicked out of my last living situation, though politely. I live alone next to my not-new-office, stuck in an expensive lease, that's eaten a lot of my unemployment benefits. 

I've been sitting alone in this apartment for the last 6 months with my dog, receiving unemployment, and just... existing. I apply to hundreds of jobs but my field is highly specialized, and difficult to job hunt in the pandemic economy due the contact nature of my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday I get a reminder of my self worth and dependency on a broken system in the form of automated responses from employers saying they're going with other people.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got scheduled appointments now with the county health teams, to set up sliding scale payment and find a new practitioner. But it feels like such a resignation. I've had to stay so strong and motivated for so long with no payoff, and I'm at my wits end here.

19319,bipolar,Worried about a roommate,"Figured I'd ask here since y'all have more experience with BD than I do.

I have three roommates right now. One of them is bipolar, which I have known for a while (she and I have been friends for three-ish years and she brought it up early in our friendship). For context, she and I also lived together last year so I know generally what she's like when she's managing well.

Last night, she sent a message to our house's group chat specifically about her BD. She said her anxiety is getting worse and she's considering moving home because of it once our classes go online (we are all in college in the US so this will definitely happen in the next few weeks). She also mentioned recent issues with sleep, both due to BD in general and because of her meds. Along with this, I've noticed some things going on that have never happened before. She's becoming more impulsive (sent me a very passive aggressive text yesterday and then immediately apologized for it because she knew she shouldn't do that and also didn't really want to, but it came to mind so she did), and she seems to be developing some obsessive compulsive type tendencies (double checking that doors are locked at random points throughout the day, refusing to leave the door unlocked for 20 minutes when we are home and in the living room so that a roommate can run a quick errand without bringing house keys, that kind of thing. It seems mostly focused on the doors being locked for now, so it's not super serious yet, but this is new for her so it worries me).

Other people I've talked to didn't seem to understand why this concerned me. I know my roommate and I know that these things are not really within the realm of normal for her when she's managing well. She was also hospitalized due to a mental breakdown because of her BD a few years ago (I wasn't her friend then so I don't know exactly what happened, all I know is things worsened quickly while she was on a trip to the UK and she ended up being hospitalized for a few weeks there). This is in part why I'm worried. I know that her hospitalization seemed fairly sudden to the friends she was travelling with, so the fact that she is noticing her anxiety getting worse combined with me noticing new issues, however minor they might seem, makes me concerned. I don't want her to end up having a mental breakdown again, for her sake and for the sake of us roommates (I don't think any of us would know how to help take care of her beyond calling her dad if that were to happen).

Personally, I think it would be best for her to move home as soon as that becomes possible. Her dad is the one who helped her get back on her feet after she returned from her trip, and he is the most likely person to be able to help her now (or get her external help if he can't provide what she needs). My issue is that I don't know how to convey this to her without sounding like an asshole, even though she is the one who initially suggested this. Part of her text yesterday was also her asking us to institute a curfew which I personally have a problem with because I work two hours past when she wants us to basically be silent (due to her sleep issues). We have also been discussing me adjusting my work schedule to allow all of us to hang out in the evenings, but her proposed curfew also directly contradicts this, which I'm struggling with because it feels a little unreasonable to me to prevent the rest of us from spending time together when we're all free because she's having issues with sleep (I know it's a perfectly good reason to ask us to adjust our schedules somewhat and try to be quiet, but we also did choose to live here for the explicit purpose of partying and hanging out late at night because this house is ideal for that). Regardless, these aren't my main concern, my main concern is about her and her mental health. My worry is that my objection to the other things will become the focus, and she'll think that I want her to move out because I'm frustrated with her requests, and not because I'm genuinely concerned about her. Of course my frustration might come into play but it is definitely not the main issue and I don't want her to think that it is.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Am I worried about nothing? Am I wrong in thinking that moving home might be best for her? Does it seem like my frustration is the actual reason for this (and if so, is there something I can adjust to make it more clear that my primary concern is her health)? I truly don't know how to approach this but I want to make sure she's making the best choices for herself and that she's getting whatever help she needs right now. This year has been tough on all of us and I'd hate to see it cause another breakdown for her."
20716,bipolar,I thought I was depressed?,"Sunday and Monday I was down in the dumps.

Nope not depression.
I had been bitten by some insect on Sunday and the flu like symptoms turned out to be an immune response to that. Yesterday morning I developed hives. Like all over my body. Itchy, burning hives. It's all I can do not to scratch them, it's so awful!!

i have tried everything to feel good. just a shred of happiness. i have tried all of the healthy things that are suggested to me, reached out to the appropriate resources, talked to close ones, etc. 

it feels like my body is giving up. i have been fantasizing about death but don’t necessarily have a set plan beyond casually bringing up what i would want to happen if i passed away to a friend.

20726,bipolar,This year and the state of my country is destroying me.,"Not saying any of this to start a political discussion. Let’s just say that I’m watching my country crumble. On top of this, there’s this fucking pandemic.  
It feels like society/life as a whole is just over. The macro effects cannot be understated. The micro effects are shredding me. No more going to museums to see art. No more going to bars to meet girls. No more dancing. No more movie theaters. No more nearly everything.  
I know that these seem like first world, privileged complaints, but I have a theory when it comes to mental health. It’s an ecosystem. Therapy. Meds. Friends. Family. Interests. Hobbies. Arts &amp; Culture. These (or some of these) are the things that keep us on track. Keep us alive.  
As a matter of conscience and responsibility, I’ve been quarantining diligently. I like my space and can be a homebody. However, that’s always been balanced by getting out of the house. Now that’s not an option. The balance is busted. “Going for a walk” is not an equal substitute.  
I know we’re all hurting right now. I know this is hard for everyone. But I’m fucking dying over here."
20728,bipolar,Doc just put me on prozac and I'm VERY nervous,Title. I've read things about prozac making you extremely manic. I cannot deal with more mania/psychosis. Everything's bad right now and I'm afraid my fiance is on the verge of suicide because of my fucking mood swings plus work and everything else. They've been mixing my meds around for months and I've been trying to deal but my episodes plus anxiety about my fucking life right now plus my hashimoto's is acting up and making me sick. If i go manic and end up back in the hospital i don't think he can't take that again. I don't think he can take much more of this...of me. I don't know what to do. Please tell me this prozac will work. I'm so scared one more manic episode is going to push him over the edge but i can't fucking stop my episodes. I think I'm depressed right now. Idk. Please help.
20729,bipolar,Plants are very inspiring,"Hi everyone! I've gotten into gardening during the pandemic, and I've found it to be very fulfilling as I go through the ups and downs of being bipolar. I recently crashed last week after being stable for 2-3 months, and it's been very difficult, but plants are something that has kept me going. 

I have mostly been going in blind to learn how to garden and take care of plants through trial and error. I've definitely killed a few. But it's the plants that are close to death that come back to life with new growth that I've found to be the most fulfilling, and very inspiring to me. Being bipolar is a very difficult thing, and having to claw your way back up after feeling good is the hardest thing in the world. Watching my plants who are close to death come back to be full and beautiful is a wonderful thing to have happen, and it really pushes me to keep working and giving myself the room to grow. 

A lot of that comes from pruning. There are lots of dead parts of a plant, or a leaf or two that dies, sometimes for no reason! I think there are a lot of analogues that you can draw from plants when it comes to being bipolar and I highly encourage everyone to get into it. I think anything that you can see a tangible difference from the work and energy you put into it really helps me continue to work through my depressive episodes.

Have any of y'all gotten into new hobbies this quarantine that have helped you through the rougher times? I would love to hear about them! sending love"
20730,bipolar,Modern Love tackling bipolar disorder,"Hello, I just wanna know if anyone here has seen Modern Love, episode 3 where Anne Hathaway is the main character? It is about bipolar and I could totally relate in most of its scenes that it made me tear up while watching. Kindly share your thoughts. Or if you haven't seen it yet, give it a go. Please also drop your show recommendations of the same genre because I am in the mood for some binge-watching. Thank you."
20731,bipolar,I'm so scared to take Seroquel,Switching from Abilify... I really don't want to get knocked out and sleep for 12 hours (that's why I stopped Abilify in the first place). I dread the weight gain. I am starting at 100mg and should double the dose after a few days. Is it really as bad as people say? At this point I am willing to get occasional hypo instead of feeling like a zombie 24/7.
20732,bipolar,"IDK if anyone else feels me too, but low self-esteem/self-pity/self-absorption/rumination/perfectionism stuff is the hardest part of my mental health to manage.","I've had multiple spells of chronic depression, a psychotic mania, fair few hypomania episodes. Yeah, they all suck and my default seems 'somewhat depressed', that sucks. But I manage. I have insight and knowledge and blah blah blah. 

What really fucks me up more than anything else, is a growing, ever harsher and more relentless chronic self criticism. It's really really gotten more prominent, chronic and punitive. 

As a social worker witha  background in psychology and over twelve years in the mental health field, I'm constantly berating and beating on myself for 'knowing better', not applying strategies, feeling frustrated that I can't move past certain things, feel like I'm deliberately self sabotaging my own self-care, and just endlessly circling the drain in perpetual cycles of ruminating on either self loathing, self pity or both. I also feel annoyed at my position of relative privilege to be wasting so much time and energy on tearing myself down.

A lot of my thinking and behaviour is driven by perfectionism, not in terms of being organised or particular, but by ruminating endlessly around self-criticism, creating wholly unrealistic and unattainable standards that only apply to me, etc. 

Recently early last year, I saw a really good psychologist and we finally starting working on some of this core self-esteem/schema stuff. Unfortunately she had to leave private practice. Since then, I've seen another psychologist but as you can probably tell, manualised CBT just kind of exacerbated everything. 

I've been trying really hard to work on self compassion, am meditating every day, trying to reframe my self talk (i.e. how I'd talk to a friend), but it seems like any attempt to remedy it, active or passive, is just worsening the self-criticism. Affirmations, positive quotes, less positive but realistic quotes, showing myself (writing, verbally) more balanced thoughts, distractions, hobbies - nothing works. And my escapism from this is usually doubling down and throwing myself at more tasks and more projects. Not ina  manic sense, just this slavish servitude to both escapism and feeling like I need to be doing more, and it's never enough. 

It's becoming intrusive and obsessive now - I can't make a cup of coffee without this shit swirling in my head and physically stopping me in my tracks, ive taken a week off work etc. Ironically, obviously it also leads to huge procrastination and whether I do something or don't just absolutely fucking hammers me with guilt all the time. 

Being someone who suffers generalised anxiety disorder as well, I find all this cognitive stuff really fucking hard to disentangle and it's just broadening and worsening to every single minute detail. Not to mention the relentless hypochondriasis, catastrophising and other bullshit that goes on in my mind with that side of things. 

Anyway, I have bit the bullet and am seeking a therapist for what feels like the billionth time. I feel if I can become a better person to myself, I can really move on with my life and not be mired in so much cyclical self-absorbed bullshit. 

Just wondering if anyone else's experience is similar, i.e. whether they feel the mood stuff is difficult but 'manageable', but the self esteem component is the real kicker of all this for them? I'm so sick of being my worst enemy and my most harshest critic. I want to be a reasonable person to myself, or better, a friend."
20733,bipolar,I don’t want to die but I can’t stop the suicidal thoughts,"Does anybody have a problem with suicidal thoughts even though you don’t want to kill your self? I’m going through a really tough depression that’s been going on a while, but I’m still optimistic about the future once I break out of it. For a while now I can’t stop having suicidal thoughts and it’s just making the depression worse. Please comment if you’ve ever experienced this and if there’s anything you’ve done to stop it."
20734,bipolar,"Going through a terrible, terrible episode.","I'm scared of myself. I just got out of a deep depression but instantly went into a hypomanic episode. Last week I didn't sleep for 5 days straight. I had so much paranoia, was hearing things. I was scared to sleep. I've been cutting myself on and off for 2 months. I've dropped back down to 99lbs somehow. In June I was making myself throw up but I'm not at the moment. Now I'm lashing out at my best friend/ex. Literally the person that is closest to me that understands what I go through, who tells me I don't have to apologize for how I feel or act. But I got my feelings hurt by something he said and I took it too far. He's always so patient and kind to me but I lashed out and he never responded. I apologized heavily and I don't think he will respond to that either. I think I could have killed myself last night. I felt the urge to, I had the razor, I even fell asleep with it in my hand and woke up with it. The thought of the act is getting more familiar and I feel like soon I won't be scared to go through with it.

 I'm seeing a psychiatrist again tomorrow and I'm going to tell her everything, it will be the first time meeting this doctor but I'm sure once it's over she will send me away to the hospital. I think I need it. I tried to get help a month ago but the psychiatrist told me to go to the hospital immediately. I didn't have health insurance, so I didn't. I wish I would have went anyway. I would have never have gotten worse. I would have never have had this episode. I would have potentially not lost my closest friend and the person who understands me the most. I had already told my friend that these episodes can he very destructive. Now he gets to see how bad of a person  I am. I was so stable when we first met and dated and everything went great. But medication was hard to keep up with when it's switching all the time. The therapist I had told me I didn't need therapy. So I stopped. And now here I am, ruining my life. This is the first week of school, and now I have to go away and catch up on the work later. I know I am capable of having a good life with good relationships but it is undeniably IMPOSSIBLE to do without maintaining this disorder. For that alone, I wish I were dead."
20735,bipolar,Effexor Withdrawal,It’s been a week now and I’m off my Effexor entirely. I feel “woozy” all the time and like I’m floating through my day. I dissociate frequently and everything seems like it’s moving in slow motion around me. It’s awful and I want this feeling to go away. Also the night sweats have been BRUTAL. My eyes feel like they are rolling around in my head and I feel absolutely exhausted halfway through the day. Has anyone else experienced this and how did you get through it? I have no idea how long this will last or how to make it easier.
20736,bipolar,Helping someone through their manic episodes,"Hello, first off want to say that I don't have bipolar disorder myself, I have ADHD, but I live with my best friend who suffers from it. We have been in a relationship in the past but have been just friends for a few years to take care of our own mental difficulties before trying again. But I still love her with all my heart, and want to be able to help her when she goes manic. I'm just looking to see if you guys can give me some tips on how to calm her down during these times, as I'm finding it difficult to get through to her"
20737,bipolar,There's no relief here,"For quite some time now, I'm talking years, I've bwen feeling constantly exhausted. I'm not talking your normal ""tired"". I'm talking, can't function or get everyday tasks done. I'm honestly beyond tired of feeling like this and I feel so alone. Not to mention absolutely useless. Does anyone else suffer from this? Is there some test I should get done? They've already done a ton - thyroid is supposedly fine. Not an iron defiency. Only thing they found was that I have Epstein Barr Virus but that is supposed to come and go and this is constant. Any ideas?"
20738,bipolar,Do other BPs like synth pop music?,It vibes for me in ways other music does not.
20739,bipolar,I told someone...,"Today, I told my best friend about this disorder, and that I suspect that I have it. He tried to make me feel better, but in a way to make me think I don't have it.

He doesn't believe me and doesn't want me to talk about that, he says he can't deal with this now, and that he tries to make me happier but I always make him sad.

I don't know what to do to anymore. I'm scared to tell anyone else. Not even my best friend believes me.

I'm dealing some problems in the family, and I don't want to make anyone upset by telling them, right at this moment.

I just don't know what to do anymore, I did research and I'm 99 precent sure that I have it. The symptoms describe my life, my behaviour. 


I don't know how to tell anyone. I'm just terrified and worried right now."
22160,bipolar,"Extremely disappointed in myself financially, don’t really know what to do anymore at this point.","I am at the point where I am sitting at $9 in my bank account with rent due in 5 days. I have been so anxious about everything that I can’t sleep, which is why I find myself writing this at 3am. I have been doing deliveries, grabbed what I could from my savings, but neglected to remember to cancel automatic payments for my loan office. I sent them an email, realizing how desperate I sounded for such a low amount of money to be returned, and am now wondering how I let myself even get to this position. 

I feel so broken and the worst part of it all is I am completely alone here and cannot get help from my amazing mother who has already done enough for me and has her own expenses to be worried about. I can’t hope for anything because I feel as if there is no possible way for me to make it to the 1st. I am hoping to call my landlord (once it is an acceptable time) and see what options I have but I am honestly terrified for my wellbeing. I wish I could just distract myself but this issue is so urgent it’s all I can think about. I just feel like a complete idiot for leaving on my automatic payments. I fault myself completely for everything. I’m honestly not really wanting to even deal with this any further.

I’m thinking that even if I happen to make rent this month, what about next month? And the next? I can’t keep living like this. Its so hard to force myself to be here when the only reason why I am alive is to make money to pay off debt that I racked up during a manic episode. I am no longer living for myself. I do nothing for my enjoyment anymore, I wake up, go to work (if I can make it, love those debilitating depressive episodes), eat enough to stay alive, and go to sleep as soon as possible. I usually try to sleep as soon as it starts to get dark because I just hate being awake. I also have’t been able to work for the past two weeks after a breakdown in late July. So the money I usually put towards my loans has been going to groceries, medicine, etc. I’ve been praying for an act of God to take me out as my anxiety stops me from doing anything to harm myself which I hate. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

tl;dr probably can’t make rent this month, I’ve lost all hope at this point, don’t know how much longer I can make it

22161,bipolar,I hate guns,"Ive been around them my whole life. You would think they wouldnt bother me. My parents own quite a few. Theres a gun safe in the room next to mine. Its always locked, but sometimes my brother leaves it open because hes negligent. I panic everytime and call him if hes not home to come and close it. Ive never told them, but you would think that since they know my diagnosis they would get it. When I freak out about it they look at me like im dumb. Even my parents talked me out of going to the hospital a year ago because I would never be able to own a gun. I hate them for it. Im going to the hospital because I want to kill myself and you think I should own a gun????

Theres been many times when im in that deep dark place that ive thought about how easy it would be. I have such easy access. All I need to do is find the key. 

Anyways I guess this is just something that goes through my mind on my darkest days. 

I never even go in that room because I dont want to look at it. My mom brought it up that he left it open and left some rifles on the bed. She thinks hes dumb because someone couldve broken in and murdered us. What about me murdering me? 

Im fine right now, but im always terrified that one day I wont be. Maybe one day ill tear apart the house looking for that key. Thats why I hate guns."
22162,bipolar,Case management?,"So I had an intake appointment with a clinic near my university yesterday to get a case manager and I was approved!! I didn’t expect to be approved so it came as a bit of a shock. 

I was just wondering if anyone here had a case manager? And what should I expect? They made it very clear that my case manager is NOT a therapist but what do I even discuss with a case manager? I just got one because it makes my family, therapist, and psychiatrist feel more at ease while I’m off at university. 

It also makes me feel kinda bad because they told me that they typically give case managers to severe cases of Bipolar so that kinda took a hit on my self esteem. But I’m trying not to let it get to me and just take advantage of these resources!"
22163,bipolar,Is it really so easy?,"My doctor is convinced that all you have to do is take meds and abstain from drugs and bipolar people will function better than normal. I feel that it’s not so easy. I’m still depressed as fuck. Sure, I have no mania but what who cares if I have no desire to live"
22164,bipolar,angry happy,"i am so angry, i dont have a reason to be angry but i also feel so damn good.

i did something stupid when i was manic, i know i am wrong. then why am i angry at them? why?

god damn, why do i feel so angry at them but also so great. i hate it so much."
22165,bipolar,"Recently diagnosed, and having a hard time accepting it.","Hi everyone. To be honest, I don’t know where to begin or really explain how I feel to this thread besides an unorganized rant. Besides my psychologist.. I don’t have many avenues to express my feelings or how to move forward, on recently being diagnosed with bipolar disorder (and ADHD).  

Please know I am not embarrassed or ashamed, I’m quite relieved in a way because I’ve been searching for answers my whole life. I’m happy to be (hopefully) be on the road to a positive future. 

Throughout my childhood into adulthood I’ve had terrible experiences with anxiety, depression, losing friendships, and what I know now or can describe as mania symptoms. But my parents are ones not to believe in mental disorders / illnesses / health, and/or therapy, they still don’t. My mental health was constantly dismissed by my parents and labeled “drama queen, exaggerated, dramatic, bitchy, it’s just hormones, etc.” 

I finally was able to find strength after experiencing some suicidal thoughts, and take matters in my own hands to begin therapy. After multiple therapy sessions with a psychologist, she believed that I am bipolar. 

I just don’t know where to begin, as I am just looking at my past years thinking ‘What if’ and feeling angry I didn’t get help sooner.  I’m wondering if I would have a better social life, or a better job if I wasn’t constantly hiding my pain, and expressing negative behaviors.  I feel angry towards my parents.  I know this isn’t a positive way to help my future, but since my diagnosis I am feeling stuck and sorry for myself, because I feel alone in this journey.  

I don’t have many hobbies, friends or ways to cope with this. I also moved to a new state 6 months ago, so I am not in a familiar surroundings. If anyone has any suggestions or advice on how they first got through the tough times of their diagnosis.. I would really appreciate it. 

I hope everyone is staying safe and well during this crazy year."
22166,bipolar,I have decided to sign up for disability services with my University. What particular services are most helpful to those with bipolar disorder?,"Hello, I have Bipolar 1 disorder and I started college recently. I am in a depressive episode and I am realizing how much of a toll this disease is taking on my college performance. Things such as oversleeping, low mood, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, low motivation, and lack of attention are affecting my ability to perform well in school and are keeping me from performing at my fullest potential. What disability services have you guys found the most helpful?"
22167,bipolar,I feel like I’m backsliding,"I had a mixed episode/breakdown three years ago. I learned to ask for help and got medicated. Things improved and I was doing well, but in June I had to add a mood stabilizer to my regimen. It’s now August and I’m having nightmares of the night I was admitted, I feel hollow and depressed and isolated- just like before my episode, which is stressing me out more and causing me to cycle. I’ve got a call into my therapist, but beyond that I don’t know what to do. I feel like my focus is gone and I’m back to being a burden on my husband. 

I don’t know the point of posting beyond I thought someone here might at least understand."
22168,bipolar,What do you say at your consultation?,"Day by day,  i write about my concerns.  However it's so messy that im not sure why to talk about at the consult.  There's can be so much concerns that has happened.  I say everything! 

What do you say at the consult? Can you provide some tips.  Thanks"
22170,bipolar,Seeing other people happy...,Just makes me feel so awful all of the time. I know I'm in a depressive episode but damn I just can't stand seeing anyone happy. It makes me feel so down on myself and have some really bad thoughts. I feel like I used to have the world and now I'm just in a deep dark hole with no way out and you would think positivity in my life would help but it just makes me more sad. Does anyone else get like this in their lows? I want to be happy like the people I see but it just reminds me of how fucked up I am...
22171,bipolar,ADHD and Bipolar,"Hi guys.
During my last psychiatrist appointment we discussed continuing troubles I've been having with my studies. He has suggested trying ADHD medication. The thing is, I can't really relate to many of the symptoms of ADHD in general. Some semesters are a breeze, some are a nightmare. It seems really odd to suggest a stimulating medication to someone with bipolar. Is anyone else prescribed ADHD medication when it is not clear if they have ADHD or not? I'd really appreciate any personal accounts to make me feel a bit more comfortable taking this course of action. Likewise I'd really appreciate if this seems a bit odd, as I really question the professionalism of my psychiatrist in general. 
Thanks"
22172,bipolar,Learning to live on my own?,"Hello, I recently moved out of my home state with my boyfriend and now my insurance won't cover me. My previous therapists who diagnosed me were all done through my parents or my school and I have no idea where to start in any of this to get a new therapist so I can control everything and work up to a job I can keep for a long time. Is there anything I should know or general advice?"
22173,bipolar,Feeling down and I have an impulse to overdose but I'm still managing this urge,"I'm really down.
Could be meds withdrawals, pandemic, my lethargy and inactivity. I don't know what to do with life, what I want. I'm 25. I was planning to do digital art but I spent the rest of the night logging out of social media.

Ughhhhh.
I think I just crashed because I was relatively energetic and happy on Monday. But then a lot of ideas came crashing along so I'm deep down.

Why overdose? IDK my other meds make me sleepy, and I love sleep. Maybe it's a good way to go? I also have really vivid dreams so you know 🤷‍♀️ an alternate reality??

Why I think I'm managing this? Because I bothered to post, I think? And I don't want to make my parents sad. They're already sad I have Bipolar ☹️"
22174,bipolar,💤,"Does anyone else experience vivid nightmares that are loosely based off past trauma? I just woke up from one, can’t sleep and won’t be comforted. I keep having repeats and it’s driving me crazy. Any advice or stories alike would be appreciated."
22175,bipolar,Weight loss after antipsychotics,Hi everyone! I recently go off of my antipsychotic for lamictal ( really better and no side effects). How many time does it take to loss the weight gain on antipsychotic?
22176,bipolar,I’m feeling really low,"I don’t know what the point is of writing this but I need to vent. I don’t know if this is bipolar depression but it feels like it. My daughter is out of school right now and has been for 2 weeks. We have 2 more to go before she is in school. I am getting really irritable and can’t bring myself to do anything. Everything my daughter does is annoying me and I’m trying really hard not to get mad at her. The tv has been on all day because I can’t deal with her right now. I’ve also spent the day trying to figure out if I should really take the classes I registered for in the fall. It’s all stressing me out not knowing if my daughter is going to be ok in school/daycare full time. I can’t deal with change at all. Every beginning of the school year stresses me out and with Covid it is so much worse. But I’m also so much in need of her to be out of the house because she drives me nuts. We have spent the last 2 weeks going out to farms and parks but now I’m just too tired to even get dressed. I just want to disappear into my phone but she can’t play alone for five minutes without me. 

I’m also really angry at the world right now for so many reasons. Racism, toxic people, unfairness - it’s all always there to make me miserable. But I’ve hit a new low. I started eating a lot of raw food and I’m wondering if it’s affecting me negatively."

Good idea to increase? Side effects to worry about?"

22181,bipolar,Does anyone else struggle to hold a job?,I am a recent college graduate and beginning my dive into the real world. I am married with a 1.5 y/o child and a very stable home life. However I still struggle to hold a job. I don't cause a ruckus or anything I just struggle in so many different ways that aren't manageable. I am diagnosed bipolar but we suspect BPD. I am afraid it's just not for me. I mostly struggle interacting with others. I am pretty social and like to have fun but my anxiety and paranoia about relationships and situations with others causes me to have pretty tough mental days. I get along with most people but I still have so many other typical bipolar behaviors that are just not good for the strict and timely business world. Does anyone else not work?

22183,bipolar,"Hypersexuality is always listed as a symptom, but I'm 30 year old woman and somewhere loosely on the Asexual spectrum. Its frustrating.","It's frustrating for me because I struggle to feel connections with most people. I have high anxiety and I get afraid ileasily in social situations, so I have so many guards up that relationships are not easy. Sex is not something that is at the top of my priority list and still a virgin tbh. 

But to be bipolar and that to be one of the big symptoms is frustrating because I feel like an imposter I guess? I was recently diagnosed and I'm still coming to terms with it, but I just.. I think that's why I was resistant to the possibility for a while because that wasn't me. 


Hooooowever.... 

I bond closely with friends and j usually have ""a person"" so to speak. I have a friend that I'm so close with and that I spend a lot of time with that person. Problem is that sometimes I think I have feelings for them and I hype myself up to think we could date. Then when I come down I think I'm a hideous hellbeast who deserves to be alone that no one will ever love. And I go through this yoyo of having feelings then getting distant with that friend. 

I'm currently in the inbetween and it just makes me dwell on the fact even more that I'll probably be alone by whole life."
23630,bipolar,Weed induced mania,Is anyone else’s mania or hypomania triggered only after smoking weed? That seems to be the common denominator for me. What induces hypo/manic episodes for y’all?
23631,bipolar,I stopped my meds for 2 days and I’m angry about the results. It’s long but I’d love to discuss with someone,"Honestly, it’s not even bad. I think I started a hypomanic episode before i stopped them, so I don’t think all of these changes were brought on by stopping them, but I started having physical withdrawal effects too. There’s a lot here, but tl;dr is that I was able to really clean myself up and make some emotional breakthroughs, but I’m annoyed that I had to get off of my meds to do it and I’m wondering if I’m going to be stuck again since I started them back up. If you happen to skim this — can anyone relate to where I’m at right now?

I was super emotional. I cried a lot. So that sucked, but being off of emotionally numbing meds just reminded me how repressed my feelings about my family and my self esteem were. So the first day (after drinking a pint of liquor to myself the day before and riding out the subsequent hangover), I bought a journal and started writing. I bought things for my hair, which is honestly a big step for me because I’m really beaten down about my hair because I don’t know how to style it and it makes me feel ugly. I was crying about it for a half hour before I finally resolved to go to Walgreens and get literally anything to help me style it the way I wanted, but as soon as I went and got it I felt powerful. And I just considered, is this really what I’m missing? Have I just been letting my calamitous emotions get in the way of taking action for my life? 

So I get home and I’m making a list of things I want to organize/clean around the house to optimize self care. Things like doing dishes for meal prep, organizing my makeup, cleaning the shower (I am VERY shower averse, idk why, and having it be dirty obviously makes it worse). I commit it to the next day. 

That same night, the bar downstairs is getting louder and louder. They break out the karaoke equipment. With covid, they’re allowed to gather outside but not inside, so all of their speakers have been directly under my bedroom window. Can’t sleep, neither can SO. Turns out the apt unit in the back of the building just opened up, and our LL left it unlocked so we could take a look at it. We do, and we make the impulsive decision to move because it’s SO much quieter and basically the same apartment otherwise. So that’s happening this week, another positive change.

Wake up the next morning and it’s my day off, and I set out to do literally all of the laundry in my house because it’s all dirty. I haven’t eaten all day because I’m feeling sick since stopping my pills. I get to having to do the dishes, my mortal enemy, also piled up and moldy, but my SO’s bags of trash are piled in front of the sink. I’m about to GO OFF in text from my hypomanic irritability at him, but halfway through I’m like “I don’t want to be angry at you, I’m just going to journal instead.” Another positive change. He thanked me for it later, saying that he felt it was appropriate for me to do. 

Journaling also brought up repressed feelings about family because I was exploring all of my anger, so I impulsively resolved to call my mom after a month of NC. That was liberating, to say the least. She’s pushing me to go back to counseling, I told her idk if I want to deal with a new intake yet. But still, we healed our relationship a little bit. Another positive change. Oh, and after this I did get some dishes done. 

And then I finally had to make myself food, because I was sick and hungry. All I could resolve to eat was buttered toast. I make it, I’m about to just toss the knife in the sink when I hesitate, thinking “I don’t want to wash this right now, I just did dishes and I’m feeling emotionally drained,” but also thinking, “it’s just a knife, and it’s one less knife that sits in the pile to rot.” I’m ashamed to say I sat in that dilemma for more than a minute before finally washing the stupid knife, but I broke the habit of not cleaning up after myself in that moment. I hope I can keep it going, but that small thing is also another positive change.

Last night, I took my meds again. I wanted to sleep. I wanted to not feel sick. My muscles were really starting to cramp up. But I’m also just upset. My meds did keep my moods stable, but I was still only living at baseline. I obviously wasn’t really taking care of myself or my home, even though I was making it to work and I’m even passing my college classes for the first time in 3 years. I take 3 days off, and yes I drank and that was bad, but that was the only bad reckless decision and I didn’t do anything awful while I was drunk. Just stayed in and played videogames. But every other day I’m able to map out my life and just feel better. No hypersexuality. No racing thoughts. Just a lot of emotional baggage being lifted and some epiphanies about how my mind is working and the actions I need to start taking before I spiral. 

I guess I’m just worried that going back to an “artificially stable” mood is just going to keep me stuck. 

Has anyone reached a similar point in treatment/recovery? Can anyone relate?"
23632,bipolar,Undiagnosed bipolar hypomania led to me getting way more exotic pets than I could care for. Please tell me I'm not alone.,"I was doing pretty okay about caring for them until the chaos of 2020 hit and now I'm really struggling and have lost a few, I don't know if it was my fault or an accident and I hate myself for not caring for them better. But my therapist says I need to have self compassion.

Venting bit that you can ignore if you want to:
_______
During hypomanic phases I ended up with like 5 aquariums over the course of a few months, kept changing my mind about what type of fish I wanted and rehoming them, and eventually rehomed them all when we moved. I then ended up getting 12 dart frogs, 3 rats, and 7 mice. 

6 of the mice have died, some of natural causes, a couple from tumors, and one from pneumonia. I did take them to the vet when they were sick even though it was like $100 each. One of them died this morning, which is partially why I'm making this post. I'm pretty sure it was natural causes but now I need to figure out how to safely re-home the other one because they aren't supposed to live alone. And I feel horribly guilty about how dirty their cage is. 

Two of my rats have tumors now, and they have lice. I can't justify $900 for surgery, but the vet said they weren't in pain and quality of life was still good, and I got lice medication but I've been struggling to apply it like I need to. I also am really bad about letting them out for playtime often enough and I feel so horrible about it I end up just avoiding them. But I have been a little better lately since I've been medicated about giving them treats, and they always have food and water no matter what, even if their cage is a mess. I know I'm trying and I so badly want to do better but I can't get my brain to cooperate when I'm stressed.

I lost my favorite group of frogs after my water sprayer broke and I didn't realize how fast their terrarium was drying out. It is a different style than the other ones I have so the other ones were fine and I didn't notice how fast it was losing moisture until it was too late. I am really sad about losing them, and wish I had kept a better eye on them. Even though I truly thought I had given them enough misting.

I keep getting behind on making fruit fly cultures and having to spend a lot of extra money ordering more, and I'm not consistent with their feeding schedule so they suffer sometimes. 
__________
End of vent.

I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. I'm an empath and I can see how much damage I'm doing but I feel like I'm in this hole that I can't get out of. I want to re-home some but I can't when they're sick and COVID19 makes everything more complicated. I want to have compassion for myself because I recognize a lot of this is what this disease (and my co-morbid ADHD which was also undiagnosed when I was getting all the pets) have done to me. But I also know how I behaved is harmful and hurting the pets I care about. 

Please just tell me I'm not alone."

23634,bipolar,How long until increased lamictal works?,"My psychiatrist upped my lamotrigine from 150mg to 175mg and then next week I will be jumping to 200mg. I've been depressed for a bit over a week now. I know it takes 2 weeks for it to qualify as a depressive episode, but I know what this is and that it could go way beyond 2 weeks if I leave it alone. I took my upped dose last night. I don't feel better today. How long until I'll feel a difference on the upped dose? :(   


What else can I do in the meantime to feel better? I'm basically living off of liquids and ensure right now because of lack of appetite. I'm due to begin lectures on September 9 and I have to supervise placement tests next week."

This sounds like sex lol but it’s not. I mean like looking for the perfect purse online or perfecting a meaningful essay or talking to someone.

When I’m doing work that doesn’t get me emotionally I can’t focus and I’m extremely bored. I can only focus and perform if it’s an emergency because it feels emotionally intense. 

Do you guys relate?

23637,bipolar,Hurricane coming!,"So a hurricane is on its way and the mom that I nanny for is downplaying it. I came to work this morning although the hurricane hits midday because she is pregnant and was having contractions yesterday. I wanted to be here in case she just so happens to give birth today because she has an appointment this morning. My cousin is home with my dog, however I do not trust her to feed her and let her out to pee daily if I get stuck here at my nanny family's house. My cousin is the type to just lock her up in a cage all day and I am completely against the cage unless guests are present and afraid of dogs. How can I tell the lady I nanny for that I would like to leave to go home when she returns for her appointment so I can be settled in my home when this hurricane hits. Her oldest son has terrible behavior and I cannot imagine being stuck here overnight for the rest of the week, I enjoy going home after a long day and being able to relax. I have bad anxiety and the night time allows me to reboost. I know how live-in situations can get where although your off at five, they will think I am content to be here and want me to be with them all night and I am not looking forward to that. Am I wrong for wanting to go home?"
23638,bipolar,The help i've gotten.,"I have lurked this subreddit for a long time wondering if this was finally the diagnosis iI had been looking for, something to help me get the help I needed. I read all the posts, relished the beautiful art that all of you posted, empathised with the highs and lows, and I felt I could speak here like I couldn't anywhere else. 

You all inspired me to the point I got over all the mental hurdles that it took to tell my parents that never believed in mental health that I wasn't ok, and that I needed to find out why. 

Since then I have been consulting with a psychiatrist and they found out that it isn't bipolar. I have a mix of depression, anxiety, ptsd, and ADHD. These combined in a way to make the appearance of mild bipolar or cyclomedia. The depression and anxiety gave me the lows and the ADHD gave me the highs. The ptsd made the moods more unstable. 

Even though I dont have bipolar, you all have helped me so much. I haven't been on here in a while because I got my life under control. I have a fun regiment of medication and therapy but for the first time I can remember, I am happy, and healthy. Without this sub and the acceptance and advice I would have still been a scared kid sitting in my room alone wondering why I should keep going. You are a fantastic group of people and I wish all of you nothing but the best in life and I hope you all find the happiness you rightfully deserve."

23641,bipolar,"First manic episode lexapro induced, was so scary","Hi all, I am 40F who apparently has been bipolar and didn't know. I have hashimptos disease and have felt like crap for the past 5 years. I now know I was having hypomanic episodes and depression cycles and I just thought it was my autoimmune disease cycling. I've been to countless specialists over the years for anxiety and depression and was diagnosed GAD instead before.

So my doc put me on lexapro and I was feeling great, energetic loss of appetite insomnia and thought my thyroid was just swinging to hyper state. Until I had a full blown manic episode. Thought I was having a heart attack but I wasn't. Very traumatic and my family freaking out escalated things. I feel so bad that my kids and husband had to see me like that.

I go back to my GP in 2 days he put me on olanzapine and xanax. Im slowly starting to recognize my triggers. My husband is freaking out. I was doing a calming app while asleep trying to come out a panic attack and it was working, he freaked out saying I need to stop.  I'm taking more xanax than is recommended but I feel like I need it right now to get through the attacks and he told me to stop taking too much. That I'm not having an attack etc etc. I made him go sleep on the couch and have rationalized things in my head now. 

I'm so scared to have another episode and I fully plan on doing therapy on the whole family. 

Just need some support, thanks."
23642,bipolar,Looking for peer advice on sexuality issues (hyposexual?),"I'm not super sure how to word this, so if it's confusing I apologise. Starting with some background, I'm 19F and I was diagnosed as type 2 maybe 1.5 years ago. I have been treated for depression for about 3 years now, and those medications did not affect my sex drive at all. As far as I can tell, the bipolar meds haven't as well, but I can't really tell for sure. 

Since I lost my virginity at 15, I have been hypersexual. I was with that partner for a little over a year, and when we broke up, I slept with quite a few people. It didn't matter if they were single or not, as long as they wanted it to happen. (I'm not proud of my decisions and I am not blaming my actions on the mental illness. Please do not criticize me on this, I do enough of that on my own.) 

Some time around the middle of last year, my sex drive tanked. I was dating a guy who, at the beginning of the relationship, had the same sex drive I had. We were like rabbits honestly. But because I lost basically all interest in sex, the relationship died very quickly. There doesn't seem to be any specific reason I stopped caring, but my body just didn't want to anymore. 

The last time I had sex with anyone was the very end of last year. I wasn't in a relationship and then the pandemic happened, which cut down on options completely. For like 6 months I could not watch any sort of sexual scene in TV shows or movies. I would skip past the part or turn it off entirely. Now I'm finding that my body really wants to have sex, but when I actually consider it and imagine the act, I get really grossed out and very turned off. I'm just wondering if it's a normal thing or there's a serious mental block that I don't know how to get around. If it is a mental block, how do I fix it? 

TL;DR Hypersexuality maybe caused too many bad associations with sex and now I'm repulsed by it. Help?"
23643,bipolar,Is it possible to be successful at work when you are bipolar?,"I remember watching a Ted Talk given by a lady who is a successful scholar but at the same time suffering from schizophrenia. She has a successful marriage, too.

Which gets me to wonder: can you be both bipolar and successful at work (i.e. in life)? 

Yes, I know that Demi Lovato is bipolar, and Google tells me that so are Sting and Catherine Zeta-Jones. And of course, then there's Kanye. But I guess what I would like to learn about is if there are any of us Redditers here (you know, like, ""real"" people) who are successful at work and can share with us how you manage?

I have been job-hopping due to my mental health issues (previously diagnosed as having anxiety and depression; diagnosed as having bipolar early this year) for the past 10+ years since graduating from university, and I am going to start a new job in mid-Sept. I would like to stop job-hopping and really make decisions that will help my career grow (for because for obvious reasons, it has not been growing in the past decade). 

Could you share with us your success story? Of how you manage to climb in your company/field, to open a successful business, to do a Masters degree (which is what I hope I can do in the near future, as it will definitely help gear me towards my ultimate career goal)  while managing bipolar?

I am having a manic episode right now--two weeks so far. My next appointment is next week and I guess I might need a higher dose of  olanzapine. I just want to be ready when my new job starts, that I will be able to focus. It has taken me 40 minutes to write this post and I'm getting dizzy and nauseous, so I will stop here."

The main reason is that my depressive episode is too hard and there’s a lot of self-harm (there’s no free place on my hand if you understand what I mean...), absolutely no ability to sleep and I lost like 10 kg for 3 weeks. I am unable to function anymore, but maybe the hospital will help me. I don’t know. I am confused and scared. But I have a question. No one (including my parents) haven’t seen my hand, which is basically cut everywhere. I injured it way too much. What will they think about it in the hospital?"

The self harm wasn't that bad, i barely hurt myself, i was wrongfully admitted, i wasn't suicidal just melodramatic, maybe it's all a lie. All the doctors got it wrong, what if I have just been lying this whole time and I forgot I was lying, i got caught up in my own lie and got confused. Yes, that's it, I'm just confused, all I need is to correct my attitude, snap out of it, maybe then, everything will be bearable again.

I don't expect replies, i just wanted to share with people who might understand, or might not, maybe I'm not sure if I belong to this group.

About a month ago I was hospitalized for severe depression and suicidal thoughts, and when I left I immediately had a hypomanic episode. I’ve gone about a week feeling normal, but it’s scaring me, because I’ve never gone this long unmedicated &amp; feeling normal. I’m theoretically “due” for another episode soon and I’m nervous about it happening during school.

School starting is usually a huge trigger for me, it either makes me horribly depressed or hypo, and I can’t control it. It basically happens every year. 

I‘m really really anxious about having another depressive episode, because last time was so horrifying. Hypo épisodes, I either make dumb embarrassing (public) decisions, drain my bank account, or just feel so irritable I spend the week crying non-stop. I’m terrified of either one, but I’m especially dreading the idea of a hypomanic episode at school, in case I do dumb shit I can’t take back.

On top of that, I’m really new to the diagnosis, so I haven’t seen a proper bipolar-specialist therapist. Hell, my last therapist couldn’t even recognize when I was depressed, let alone give me any advice on how to cope with it. I really don’t know what to do when I’m in the middle of an episode.

However, I experience extreme physical shifts in temp, pain, digestion, nervous system, etc cyclically. Both extremes bad and good back and forth anywhere from 1-6mo each cycle lasts. I learned how to suppress emotional shifts after years of counseling. I am the most emotionally stable person I know.

Okay so my sister and I are pretty close and we usually get along but then some days its like she just wakes up and hates everything. Everything and everyone is annoying her, even the dog we have, and she loves that dog.   


She often goes through phases where she is either happy like really happy, like calling me and saying she loves me more than anything, or she is super down and hates everything and complains about simple things, ive seen her break down and cry because there was no apple juice at home.   


She is very anti medication and she says  psychologist judge her and acts as if she is crazy. So I am at a loss with how we can help her, since she has no diagnosis I cant assume what would help her, I dont know what to do, her anger periods sometimes last for months and its draining me that she flips out on me and the family all the time...

I feel like I am beginning to take on water and I am trying to stop the leak before I sink. I am taking my meds and seeing my doctors as usual, but due to some issues with losing friends/girlfriends because of the stigma I tend to keep my mental health issues to myself.

I know they can come with some complications for obvious reasons, depression, anxiety attacks , PTSD, agoraphobia, possible BPD, and of course there are my own issues, having bipolar disorder, my own struggles with agoraphobia, anxiety attacks, PTSD, but Im currently stable (cross fingers).... That can be a tricky mix. But there is A LOT about them in particular that makes me think they're the smoothest bet... When it comes to how much physical stuff they have, how much we have in common and knowing each other at our worst, minimal complications with more people, VEGETARIAN! ect... Would it still be a bad idea? Especially if I end up having to take care of them or vice versa.... 

Now there's obviously also COVID... 

My Dad is old now, late 60's and has had major health issues in the past... And is especially sensitive. I'm feeling super conflicted about how much risk I'd be adding if there was another person involved. I see my family, parents and bother, who live in one household regularly now. I'm also worried my dad would take even the suggestion or pondering of having an apartment mate as not valuing his life, HUGE CONCERN of mine since the relationship is complicated. I don't think mentioning they are low risk for catching it would help at all, or any logic even if I personally decide not to. 

And this is where I feel like a bit of a dick. They're agoraphobic, as am I on and off and significantly in the past, so there wouldn't be as much risk in that regard. Also won't be people coming and going, as is currently. I do see one friend but she's been tested and cleared so I feel that's fair?

This ended up longer than expected. Thanks for reading for those who did.

25143,bipolar,Well I have cancer,"Great time to be on meds though. I’m feeling pretty calm. Being mildly hypomanic helps since I’m just aggressively researching and planning and scheduling. 

Really lucky because it was caught just about as early as possible. I’ll be okay, I’m just in for a rough few months. 

I know it’s not really bipolar related but I found out yesterday and I’ve been trying to process but I’m just not really feeling.... anything?"

25147,bipolar,Stupid question? (Hospitalization vs Self Care),"Hi all.

So, I have a lot going on, including issues with med changes that I’m already planning to switch doctors due to (backstory, my doctor misdiagnosed me for 13 years and just now put me on what I believe to be the correct med, but I also believe I need an additional med for the lows. I was taken off of Lamictal for Lithium but I seem to be suffering regardless. I see a lot of people take both. Hate to be *that* patient but I don’t think my doctor has dealt much with bipolar patients... he never really takes all my issues into consideration. 13 years focusing on my lows and now suddenly only focusing on my mania).

I also have a severe panic disorder that has worsened. I’m an essential employee and I self quarantine daily because I cannot afford to miss days at work, and with the removal of a med for lows (when misdiagnosed I was always on some kind of antidepressant) it’s been a recipe for the worst sudden onset panic attacks. I called out of work last week because I had one oncoming for hours before my meds kicked in (I’m on alprazolam) and I had one at work two days later.  

Here’s my issue. With my panic attacks being so much more intense, and now my lows being horrific, I’m aware that this could all be fixed at my next visit if I’m as honest and persistent as possible that I’m, frankly, losing my mind. Or, more likely, it will be fixed by switching doctors (already have one in mind that a friend recommended). But, I feel like I would benefit the absolute most by a voluntary admittance to a hospital. I really, truly believe it to be the reset I need, and hopefully with doctors that will treat me correctly.

The issue is... I can’t afford it. I can’t afford to miss work, either (no job security). My insurance is trash. It would kill me financially. A part of me wonders if maybe the thought that this is what I need is just a new intrusive thought since i stopped Lamictal. 

So, I’m waiting it out until Sept 8th (my next appt) and I guess I will see from there. I’m wondering if there’s *anything* I can do at home to provide any type of self care that mimics, even slightly, the results of spending time in the hospital. Hence my title, as this is probably so stupid to even ask. I’ve never been admitted, I don’t know if there are things I can recreate — techniques, activities, etc. I wasn’t sure if someone could help, or if anyone has a really great self care regimen?

Again, Sept 8th is my next appointment and if I *do* switch to this new doctor after, she runs an entire psych unit and so who knows if I wind up being encouraged to admit anyway. Until then though, I just really need help to figure out how to somehow make my time at home better for my brain. 

I hope everyone is doing okay. This is a rough year."
25148,bipolar,Im so confused...,I'm so confused with my life right now... I want everything to work out but I know something will happen where it will affect me... I'm going to school but switched my major 3 times and I hope I don't get depressed again :/.
25149,bipolar,how would you describe how it feels to be bipolar to an outsider?,"For me, one of the most frustrating parts of living with bipolar disorder is feeling misunderstood.

How would you describe it?"
26645,bipolar,is this symptoms of mania/hypothermia !!! please help !!,"hello ! two months ago i got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and stated prozac. during sessions before and after i was diagnosed i was extremely depressed, so this was all that my doctor and therapist were able to see. 

when quarantine where i live had gone into effect (march), i had felt ecstatic for the first two weeks the best i had felt in my life, i had an enormous amount of motivation and energy and had felt a true sense of euphoria. i typically have a rather low self esteem however during this time period i was obsessed with my self truly believing that i was the most attractive person alive and couldn’t understand why others did not feel the same (this is incredibly humiliating looking back now.) i was the most talkative i have ever been my mind was racing i had so much to say i would spend the entirety of the day talking excitedly to myself or friends, blabbering on abt everything, i had felt a real sense of chaos. however despite meeting most of the symptoms associated with mania/hypomania i did not have a decreased need for sleep but higher energy levels ) then everything switched suddenly i then fell into a very deep depression ( but i won’t get into that). 

fast forward, abt a month and a half on prozac i began to feel as i did before ( i had been experiencing these dramatic mood swings for many years before this) i spent abt a week and a half experienced great these manic symptoms and extreme happiness, and had impulsivity to do things i would normally not, although no deceased sleep. one morning i was particularly “happy” and then i had suddenly felt paralyzed and mute but the internal chaos and racing, crazy thoughts had continued leading me to be extremely paranoid, indecisive. then i fell back into a deep depression for the remainder of the night and the next day. 

after bringing up these weird distressing mood swings to my therapist and doctor, they asked me abt if i had had a decreased need for sleep and after i awnsered no they stopped asking questions related to mania and claimed that this was simply my anxiety and nothing to be concerned abt. (i feel that i did not let on just how serious things have gotten, and was feeling unheard). this lead me to spiral, and belive i was stuck in a dream which i had to escape by kms. i ended up in the hospital that night. 

(note: i currently do not have many stressors in my life compared to before this mental breakdown, and these feelings of pure insanity and chaos and mood swings feel different then anxiety) 

could i have bipolar disorder or is this simply an presentation of anxiety ( which i do not feel it is) 

i apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes 

thankyou in advance !!"
26646,bipolar,Here we go...again...damnit,"I will have had three appointments in 3 days. I am on watch. I refused hospital for now.

The flare is dead on. No one listens. ""Oh it will be alright!"". No it wont. Not right now. In fact its going to get worse.

Its taking all my strength to stay sober. Started the walk to the store. Turned around. Just want it to stop. Got taken off klonipin and ambien and its been a living hell. I dont sleep. I cant relax. My body hurts and I'm losing my damn mind. Would kill for either. I havent slept 6 non broken hours since I got out of the nut house 6 months ago.

Fingers crossed its minimania. Oh god please be minimania. I have one person left after the last episode. It sucks. I miss my xs (yes, multiple).

Everyone is pushing for me to rent a room. I cant afford it but theres this idea people have about me and its more what Im supposed to be which I am far from. I need to live alone to contain the crazy and not have consequences when I say or do something stupid. Family hates me. Only friend wont help.

Im pretty certain I will be living in my car. I'm packed but to sleep in it I would have to throw away a lot. Found an RV. Could pay for it cash. Nope. The person that holds my money won't give it to me.

I feel like a child. Powerless and alone. So, my childhood all over again.

This disorder is horrible. Dealing with it another 40 years is a nightmare.

Fuck this. Might as well reserve a room at the crazy people prison."

26650,bipolar,Applying for internships/jobs,"Hi all, I had two questions about applying for internships and jobs. One, is it a good idea or no to disclose I have bipolar when applying for jobs? I have a spotty academic record due to hypomanic episodes and just a long period where I wasn't in school or working that is hard to explain away without revealing I have bipolar, do I just say I have a disability and just leave it at that? Will employers see me as suspicious if I say I have a disability but don't disclose it to them? Second, if I'm applying for jobs, is there a letter I need to include from my psychiatrist that says I have a disability? Doesn't that kind of reveal the nature of my disability if they see its from a psychiatrist? How do employers know people aren't just lying about having a disability unless there is some sort of official letter confirming so? Thanks, sorry for all the questions!"
26651,bipolar,Would it be fair if I told people I’m bipolar?,"Several months ago I brought up to my psychiatrist that I think I might be bipolar. She heard me out and prescribed me lamictal, and since I’ve been taking it I noticed a completely night and day difference in terms of mood stability and ability to do daily functions. She’s not the type to do formal diagnoses, so she never actually diagnosed me with bipolar—she’s more of a problem/solution kind of person I guess?? But sometimes when talking to people about my mental health I’ll tell them I’m bipolar. Very rarely though, usually I just tell them it’s likely that I am. Is this something I should wait until I get a proper diagnosis to do or is it fine?"
26652,bipolar,Seroquel no longer making me tired at night,"After quitting my ssri (Lexapro), I no longer feel my Seroquel at bedtime, which sucks because I have insomnia. It’s really strange; I literally don’t feel anything despite increasing my dosage. The only way I get to bed at night is through melatonin or CBD oil. Has this happened to anyone else? It happened right when I quit the Lexapro, which is strange because before taking the Lex, I would get really tired from Seroquel."
26653,bipolar,Why am I like this,"I (20m) feel very romantically lonely but don't know where/how to meet people my age. Everyone said to use dating apps but from my experience, I only use them when I'm manic and narcissistic. When that happens, my standards become impossibly high (not necessarily just appearance), I never swipe right on anyone, and never even give anyone a chance so I just end up lonely again with no matches. It's like I always find *some* reason to swipe left. I feel bad later because I realize I'm probably a horrible person for it but I just get **extremely** disappointed with the boring people on these apps (I think part of the problem is where I'm located but unfortunately I can't change that anytime soon). I also really hate people that put their political views in their profiles (around here that's 1 out of every 3 profiles) and are very in-your-face about it.

When I'm depressed I'm so fucking out of everything that I can't even fathom trying to flirt with someone because my self confidence would be nonexistent and I would sound really boring and have no energy.

Why am I like this; I just end up sabotaging myself either way."
26654,bipolar,Hi. I’m scared. :(,"Long story short I (25F) lost both of my ex boyfriends last year (they died tragically six weeks apart) and my sister shortly after. My mom also overdosed and died in 2015 and my other sister killer herself when I was 10. Soooo much mental illness. 

I got completely sober after that in April 2019. 

Started working and things were ok for a while. Then COVID happened. I lost my job but felt really weirdly ok with isolating since everyone else was. I didn’t put any focus on getting a job or improving my life really. I sort of just existed. 

Now that phase 4 is happening in my city, I feel so much pressure. I was hospitalized August 8 for wanting to kill myself. I’ve been to a residential program but hated it and left. I start PHP Thursday. 

This is all background - the last week or so I’ve been absolutely in complete existential crisis / dread and complete panic about the future. About living. I think I’m scared I’m going to end up like the women in my family I’m terrified to live my life. I have no idea wha to do with my life but I am also wondering what the fuck the point of it all is anyway?! I don’t want to live my life. I mean I do. But it is so hard. It’s so much work. I’m just so scared of living. Tired of trying. I’m also just fucking bored.

My boyfriend of 2 years is bipolar and we have gone through a lot together when it comes to his mental health! Lately, he will wake up in an angry mood and consistently stay there throughout the day. Usually a dream or something small will provoke the mood, it usually has nothing to do with me. Unfortunately, I feel as though he ignores/mistreats me when he is in these moods, I have pretty bad anxiety and not being talked to or being talked to in an angry tone really weighs on me, but I feel as though mentioning it will make it worse. He has a lot of self-destructive thinking (“i’m just a piece of shit” etc) so it’s hard for me to advocate for myself sometimes without starting a spiral. Any advice from y’all? Something to note is that he is getting back into therapy after a long hiatus (therapists are really hard to schedule with where we live). Thank you!"

I feel like I am at my best (until it gets to the point where lack of sleep and doing too much makes me a little mad)

So I guess this is just normal and I can expect to feel like this the rest of my life. And every couple months I reach a state where I wonder what the fuck the point is. I’ve been like this for nearly 14 years. Does anyone know how fucking awful that is??? Does anyone care? Nothing makes me happy or brings me joy anymore. Nothing makes me feel positive. I hate my body. I hate my mind. Nothing is okay. I hate feeling and thinking this way. I wish I could be happy. Not just swinging back and forth between manic and soul crushing depression."
26666,bipolar,"If I refuse to take my medication, could it hurt me in the long run?","I mean as far as asking for other prescriptions goes?  


Last year I was put on Lamictal.  Worked pretty well but when it was increased, I felt like I was on the verge of an asthma attack 24/7.  I told my doctor then and I stopped.  Symptoms decreased and were gone after a week.  Then I tried Abilify after seeing a new doctor (dr. 1 moved.)  My anxiety got so bad that I would rip my hair out, curl into a ball, and cry for hours.  I was put on lithium.  


Flash back to the present.  Dr. 2 left as well but we were in the process of coming off of Abilify.  I finally come off 100% and shoot down into a huge depression.  Dr. 3 puts me back on Abilify (I was willing to see how it worked with lithium.)  However the anxiety is rearing its ugly head again.  I told her about it and she suggested lamictal again.  I'm on the verge of just taking myself off Abilify and flat out refusing lamictal.  I don't mean to be a difficult patient but Jesus.  One makes me not breathe and the other makes me want to kill myself.  


TL;DR - I had a bad reaction to lamictal and my doctor wants to put me back on.  I also had a bad reaction to Abilify but am trying it again to see if I got better results with lithium on board.  Answer appears to be no.

I guess my question is, if you have not complied with medication before, has it prevented you from getting something you asked?  Ive asked for my Klonopin back (which I never abused) and even Buspar.  Just fucking something to help with this anxiety."

We don’t have that kind of money and I would try to help her understand but she would get angry and say that she needs it and she never spends any money which is not true. She became an excess hoarder and kept everything. She made up these insane stories and told everyone ridiculous stories. If she doesn’t want to listen she would start crying and would hang up. She talks for hours and will not let anyone talk. She insults the whole family and does not quit. She dropped to the floor on purpose then called the ambulance to take her to the hospital. We then checked her into the hospital for a week and she just came out and she hasn’t changed a bit. It seems like she wants to do whatever she likes and won’t listen to reason.

28194,bipolar,Anyone experience hair loss after taking Lamictal?,"I used to have thick, long hair with normal fall out after a shower or brushing. I have been slowly increasing my dosage of Lamictal with my doctor for two years, I ended up on 125 mg a day. In February my stylist told me that she saw some thinning at the crown of my head and asked if I noticed any hair loss. I had been, but I can't see the top of my head and didnt think much of it. In the shower, after shampoo it would just come out, bunches of strands at a time . Not big patches in certian sections but a ton of hair from all over. I cut my hair to my shoulders to see if that would help slow down the fall out, but it didn't. 

For reference I am 26 years old, female with Bipolar II, only taking Lamictal and Nuvaring for birth control. I dont smoke or drink, eat pretty healthy but dont work out a lot. I'd say I'm pretty average, and nothing in my genetics show female hair loss this early, if at all. I wanted to see if anyone noticed hair loss after taking Lamictal also? I have been under a lot of stress this last year and it could be that but wanted to see if there was any anecdotal evidence in line with what I've experienced. 

I was on the nuvaring years before starting Lamictal and never had a problem. I stopped birth control in February to see if that was the culprit but alas, no change. I haven't stopped taking Lamictal but will definitely bring it up with my doctor for a possible med change if it seems to be the case. It has taken a toll on my mental health as I have a difficult time with self love and acceptance, so I'm trying everything I can!"

28201,bipolar,Bipolar with only depression ?,"Hello this is my first post here

I had a discussion with my psychiatrist, I was hospitalized for a few months to treat a severe depression and now I am much, much better. I do not need medication now. Today was the last time seeing my psychiatrist on a weekly basis and he told me something that stucked with me but I didn't have the time to ask him the question

He told me he once thought I was bipolar because I had depressive episodes but bipolar medication (lithium) didn't seem to work on me so he shifted back to antidepressants.

So it doesn't seem that I am bipolar as far as I know, I never had manic or hypomanic episodes . But I was wondering does bipolarity sometimes is only recurrent depressive episodes ? I searched online but didn't find much answer

All of a sudden on Saturday I felt like I got hit by a bus. I slept for 14 hours and and just do not want to do anything. I’ve been binge eating and laying around all day after I get home from the school. And I’m just sooooo tired all the time. 

I haven’t changed meds, I’m not sick, and my mood is fine. I’m not sad or anything, just beat. Do you guys think this could be a depressive downswing or just feeling lazy? Kinda sad when you can’t trust your own mind and body lmao."
28205,bipolar,"5 Months after my hospitalization, I had my appointment with my psychiatrist.","It turns out that the medication I'd stopped taking months ago because it was causing me pain and twitching was a mood stabilizer.

Which would explain the 2 hypomanic episodes, depressive episodes, and agitation that have been wrecking my life.

Got put on a new med today. Here's to having my life back finally.

And also, fuck Covid for messing up everyone's schedule so bad that this is the first time I got to talk to a doctor. I'm ready for all of this to be done with."
28207,bipolar,Does anyone have experiences with drinking while on Latuda?,"I no longer do this, curious of others experiences."
28209,bipolar,How do you manage being bipolar and work?,"Hi guys.

*Heres my rant:* I'm unemployed and searching for jobs at the moment. I've finished a bachelor degree at university, and even though my last grades were horrible, I finished! I graduated! Anyhow I've always thought that it would be somewhat easy to get a job. I'm now a social worker (with bipolar type two apparently). I've graduated university, volunteered a lot, and I've had jobs. I've always done quite well, but it isn't easy to get a job at all! And since I've been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder through my last year of uni.. It just made my life a whole lot more difficult. I was supposed to call places I want to work, and tell them that I'm free to work anytime.. But I have anxiety. I've applied for like 40 or 50 jobs. The only job I was offered (for now) is a job at a recruitment agency - and I have anxiety. I didn't want that job, and they haven't given me any work since I took the job (two weeks ago). I'm not guarantied money, and I have to show up at a new workplace for a day or two to work - and then leave. I don't define this as having a job at all. I just needed something to put on my CV. My first day is tomorrow - and I have to travel for an hour to get there. I have to travel for every job I take. What bothers me is the fact that I was supposed to graduate and get a job that I like. I wasn't supposed to graduate with poor grades, be diagnosed with a bipolar disorder, be unemployed and have difficulties finding a job.

How are everybody else doing when it comes to work? Do you have a job? What do you do? And is having a bipolar disorder a problem when it comes to work?"
28211,bipolar,Latuda makes me want to commit suicide.,"It makes me feel hopeless and reminds me of a lot of lonely nights before.

I never skipped a day of medicine. Never contemplate skipping it.

But I really want to stop latuda.

Please help. I just want to die."
28212,bipolar,Either extremely confident or insecure...,"Anyone else feel this way? I feel I only have 2 moods. Being super confident bordering on arrogant or self deprecating and feeling low.

The thing is sometimes I genuinely feel low about myself and the cockiness is just a shield. And other times I am extremely cocky and feel like I’m the greatest thing since sliced bread and use the self depreciation to fish for compliments.

I think when I’m manic I get the extremes of both but when I’m depressed I only use my self deprecating humor to get people to pity me..."
28213,bipolar,"Saw a post about grad school and that’s awesome, so I also wanted to share something","While completing an intensive Psych eval I also did an IQ test, a legit one, and I didn’t even know I was until halfway through, and I scored in the 98th percentile, “superior” range.  


I just wanted to share to encourage you all, that despite our bipolar disorders, they don’t define us, you can do great things and be who you want to be."
28214,bipolar,Others doubting my diagnosis,"I was diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder at the age of 18. Everyone thought it was severe depression until my first round of antidepressants triggered hypomania. I even had bouts of it without the medication (hypersexuality, lack of sleep, racing thoughts, talking fast, etc.) I only saw a therapist/psychiatrist for a couple of months since I dropped out of school and no longer had insurance.

I’m now 23 (still with no insurance despite working full time — USA! USA!) and struggle every couple of months as I become depressed/rapid cycle through a lot of emotions.. but I’ve also had a couple people doubt my diagnosis. My boyfriend of a year doesn’t think I have bipolar disorder, and my new therapist also expressed doubt with my diagnosis. 

Do I hide it well? Is it really just depression? Has my condition mellowed out since then? I don’t think I’ve latched onto it as a part of my identity, but I also don’t know what else would explain everything I’ve gone through. Despite being pretty high functioning, I’ve been to the psych ward twice and keep cycling through highs and lows. It’s also really difficult for me to keep a full time job, I’ve been at my current one for a year and I have a really strong urge to quit and drive aimlessly. 

Anyone else relate? Has anyone expressed doubt over your diagnosis and if so, how did it make you feel?"
29760,bipolar,IDK what to do,I have a job a simple only stressful at times. But I’m bp1 with psychotic features .I noticed it on my 3rd week in and the stress apparently according to my doctor is brining out my psychotic symptoms I noticed I can’t handle any sorta fast or the stress that comes once in awhile  I being to get really hot and angry and wanna throw shit and just scream cussing at my work. I’m scared I might hurt someone sooner or later. I can get socail security but that requires me to sit around the house all day feeling lazy no offense to anyone on it it’s iust my pride trying to beat something it can’t. I’m at a loss and don’t know what to do
29761,bipolar,need help quitting smoking,"I went from smoking cigerellos to cigarets to a pipe to vaping back to a pipe.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that quiting smoking is harder for bipolar people.

&amp;#x200B;

I have heard that on terms off addiction from hardest to least hard to quit it goes Cigaerrets, Cigars, Pipe.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to stop smoking because I can over do it and it makes me nauseas or under do it and i get really edgy and angry. As well I dont need to be adding more chemicals to my body on top of my meds or maybe even making the bipolar worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I cant use patches because it gives me muscle weakness and soreness where ever i out them on, vaping i could never reduce the nicotine, if i did i would just vape more until i burned the coil out and made myself sick... right now im smoking 3 or 4 bowls of tabaco in a pipe a day and also it would be nice to have the extra 210 bucks a month because I am on disabilit6y.

&amp;#x200B;

I just convinced myself when i started that""bipolar suffers need nicotine to maintain mood.""

&amp;#x200B;

I cant go cold turkey because I get way WAY to snappy and angry.

&amp;#x200B;

So if any one has advice or suggestions to read quitting or even ideas i would appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. The good news flair is used because i think its a massive step for me to even think about quitting."
29762,bipolar,Today my disability examiner said something...,Wow I just talked to my disability examiner And he did my work history over the phone and he told me based on what he's seen he thinks I'll get approved. He said he's not usually allowed to say that though because he doesn't make the decision. Now it's gotta go to the Drs to make the decision and he said I should know something in the next few weeks or month. Wish me luck guys!!!! I really need this.

29768,bipolar,"I have extreme olfactory senses, and I am a little deaf, idk but I hear the slightest vibrations to humming sounds too. I am not comfortable with it. Does anyone else also experience these? Manic",:)
29769,bipolar,Mixed episode going into mania,"I can feel another episode coming from and I've been noticing something I didn't pay attention to before.

Every time I go into an episode it's like I disconnect so much that I don't recognise any of my loved ones. When I feel this way I often want to hurt them or discard them from my life. I don't want to go too much into detail, but I deal with some pretty bad compulsive thoughts and tendencies.

Do anyone else feel this way, or does someone have an explanation as to why this is happening? I'm scared of what might happen when I don't feel anything for anyone I love"
29770,bipolar,Alcohol is the devil.,Just like the forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden the long term consequences outweigh the immediate euphoria. Call me Eve.
29771,bipolar,Does anyone have memory issues while being on lamictal or lithium?,"I'm on both along with a low dose SSRI. I've been on the lamictal for a few years but just started the lithium last September. I've noticed in the last several months that I have a more difficult time remembering some things. I'm only 31 so it's not like I've had regular memory issues like my aging mother has. But I've noticed it most when it comes to holding on to sources of information. For instance, in my state one of the candidates for senator ran for governor two years ago. I really liked their platform, I liked their ideas, and their vision for the future so I'm excited for them to run again. But when people ask me why I like them I can't remember. I can't tell you what it was I liked about them or what they had said or what their goals were. I just know I like them. 

I also have this issue with leaving my church. I was taught my entire life that this was the one and only true church. But I recently discovered a bunch of information that completely disproves it. My whole family is still very much believing and don't trust me when I tell them what I have learned. They say, ""where did you get that information? The internet? Do you believe it just because somebody says so?"" Even though I know what I know I couldn't tell ya how I know it. If I have the time to write it out I will go grab resources off the internet to share but I can't hold on to those resources in my head. 

Now that I've written this all out, maybe my issue is just getting flustered in conversation. IDK. It is really disconcerting because I used to be able to whip that stuff out but now I feel like I just don't have the energy to hold onto it. I research enough to know something and only hold onto the knowledge. I toss out the why and how I know something. Like my brain is too full or too tired to hold onto any extra details than are absolutely necessary.

Does anyone else experience this? Is it just me?"
29772,bipolar,I've mood tracked for almost a whole year.,"&amp;#x200B;

Vertical lines: Before red= hardcore school, no meds, very little exercise, no treatment; Red= restarting strenuous exercise regimen, low stress (as in no school or work. basically just exercising) lots of outdoor activity; Purple is addition of abilify with exercise/outdoor activity; green is addition of lithium and school with abilify and exercise/outdoor activity; blue is lithium, abilify, school, exercise/outdoor acitivity and full time work. 

Horizontal lines: 4 is what I consider stable; yellow to red is mild to severe mania (7= severe mania, i didn't have severe mania this year); green to purple is mild to severe depression (1=suicidal, probably should be hospitalized maybe?).  

Linked is the rating system I found in a paper that I use to define my scale (1-7 with 4 being stable, 1-3 being severe to mild depression, 5-7 being mild to severe mania). 

What do you guys think? What next steps would you recommend for treatment? :)"
29773,bipolar,Just discharged from 12 hours in the ER. They gave me nothing but some papers.,"I posted here a few days ago and was advised (by many of you) to go to the ER as I don’t currently have a pdoc and seemed to be in an “elevated state”. I called the ER and they agreed, but I was too scared to go in. Fast forward to Monday and I called my old psychologist. He told me to go to the ER as well. So I swallowed my guts and went, hoping that they would help. All they did was make me wait 12 hours and game me some pamphlets. The psychiatrist there was hesitant to say he was completely positive I was bipolar because in my “elevated state” I wasn’t euphoric. Though they discharged me with papers saying they diagnosed me as bipolar (I was initially diagnosed by a psychologist during quarantine), I feel a little invalidated. just the way the doc talked to me. And kept asking the same questions. I don’t know. It’s not that I want to be bipolar. But having an answer to explain how I was feeling felt great. I feel like he put a crack in that. They didn’t adjust my meds, just sent a social worker to give me some names of psychiatrists and therapists. 

At least they paid for the taxi home."
29774,bipolar,DAE feel like they’re lying to themselves or forcing themselves to be bipolar?,"I actually wrote some of this in a journal entry a few months ago and even once mentioned it to my at the time partner, so I know I’ve thought/felt this before.

Sometimes I find myself in a really good mood. Talkative, energetic, laughing a lot, initiating conversations, joking around with people, being “myself”. And I feel great for hours. Then suddenly, a switch flips and I question my mood.

I think “should I allow myself to be happy? Or let the sadness sink back in?” 9 times out of 10, my depression hits and my good mood is gone. Then I wonder... am I forcing myself to be depressed? Am I forcing myself to be anxious and have panic attacks? Am I forcing myself to have suicidal thoughts?? Do I WANT to be miserable?

Am I faking everything? Am I making myself feel these things? For what? So people will feel bad for me? Because I want attention? Just lying to everyone and myself?

I literally question everything I feel and doubt myself and my feelings all the time."
29775,bipolar,“The Reddit Red Dot!”,"Your alarm goes off, you find a way to get out of bed, still in a fog from your night meds. You reach to pick up your phone and the very nanosecond it unlocks, there it is, “The Reddit Red Dot” notifying you that you have messages. It’s just sitting there, waiting for you to click it open. It tickles your nerves, and your mouth salivating to calm your nausea; you begin to experience a combination of curiosity and dread! It could go two ways, either it can be a notification for receiving 5+ upvotes regarding the cute Rainbow Care Bear you posted on r/carebears or it could be a plethora of rants of distain about a manic post and you are now prepared to hate everyone! 

You think carefully before tapping the Reddit icon to see what’s on the other side. BAM!! That’s the sound of your phone hitting the floor while you pretend to not let it bother you and walk away. You open your morning med case, and the thought hits you, .... that red fucking dot! You try to invent ideas that might have played out, you even look at the clock thinking, “what time did my meds kick in last night?” You brush your teeth, feeling a small victory for having done so, and there it is, now burned on your brain.. the Reddit red dot!! — You quickly pick up your phone, you delete the app, you lock your phone. You take the step out of your bedroom to take on a world without Reddit, and with clean teeth, no less.. 

It’s now lunch time, you hear your phone ping, you have an email. Yet, this does not terrify you as much because it’s most likely junk mail or some bot telling you when the next support group will meet on Zoom. You pick up your phone while eating your lunch, only to hear the sound of chewing permeating the room. You pass all the news: Donald Trump? Nope! Coronavirus? Nope! Racist counter protests to BLM? Nope! None of this matters now because, once again, you’re stuck thinking about that fucking Reddit red dot!! You feel as though life cannot continue, you must know!! Thoughts of “ohhhh no!! I messed up again!” Or “I revealed my username to a friend, I’m no longer anonymous or safe!! You then click to re-download the Reddit app.

29776,bipolar,Losing a dear friend.,"About 6 years ago was my most serious suicide attempt, the closest to death I’ve ver been. On a vent for 4 days and in the hospital for over a week. It took more than 15 years for me to get a diagnosis but here I am today ‘stable’. I still have some ups and downs but I am so fortunate to have found my survivable balance.  Over the last two years I’ve had a few ‘slump’ episodes, my therapist calls it the blues. But I’ve been void of my suicidal thoughts. It’s been so freeing. Like I said I’m so incredibly fortunate. 

Today I learned that a dear friend and family member took his own life. He was a gentle giant who cared for everyone. He was the kindest and most compassionate person I’d ever met. It breaks my heart to think about the thoughts that he had going through his head. I’ve been there. I’ve felt that and I know what it’s like to want it to all be over. I know that we usually bottle up those feelings and don’t let people know. We’re all generally pretty great at masking those things. 

I wish you all the best. Please remember that even though we may not know each other IRL, this is a community full of support. We’re all here for one another, reach out. Take care of yourselves."

29778,bipolar,Lithium Citrate? Liquid Lithium?,"Hi, I've been diagnosed bipolar for about 6 years now, and i've been taking lithium carbonate. I'm moving to another country soon (from the US) and the pharmacist that I know in the new country told me that they don't make my dose of lithium carbonate (900mg, they only make even numbered doses). She suggested that I take lithium citrate instead.

Does anyone know anything about lithium citrate? Does it taste bad? Do you just put it in water and drink it down? 

Thank you!"
29781,bipolar,What would happen if u started lithium suddenly after weeks of not taking it?,I don’t know if this is the right sub to ask this in but I ran out of lithium and my script could not be refilled due to it being out of stock. I just got my refill this morning and I was wondering if it is safe to continue my 1200mg daily dose as normal. I take 300mg in the morning and 900mg at night. I know lithium is eliminated from the blood stream in 5-7 days so my blood level would be barely traceable or there wouldn’t be a reading. Thanks for any advice.
29783,bipolar,I regret nothing,"So yeah, this is ass-hole me cheating death yet another time.

I've had it with this shitty non-condition that I super-know that I have...

Right now having a super-mixed episode that I sensed would happen in over two weeks now.

I'm super irritable both because I've been having a gazillion beers plus smokes and a LOT of coffee and than I think I shouldn't but also think that I should push myself to getting more efficient at getting my shitty existence on to a livelier rythm.

Really this is just a rant and it should pass within a few dozen hours but i really am freaked at asking my support system for a break.

This has been a tough five weeks since a lot of my root systems have had a tough time adjusting to the prospect of a very highly demanding job.

I need to switch to a more energetic mode and the stress sensors that I set up are unexpectedly off the roof atm.

I've been diagnosed ten years ago but I sense that, this is different.

I really suck ass at managing this shit i really do and I fucking hate myself for that."
29784,bipolar,I feel like a child,"Tonight I looked at the sky above my house and saw it cracked, like the glass on a phone screen. I wanted to go to the park to see if the park had a real sky and my husband followed me the whole way.  He kept telling me what to do, like that I had to wear shoes even though I was enjoying the feeling of the sidewalk on my feet, and he kept saying that if I didn't listen he would call the cops to take me to the hospital which he knows has been traumatic for me in the past.

I'm calmer now and recognize how irrational the sky thing seems but I saw what I saw and needed to go investigate.  

I feel manipulated and babysat and don't like it."
31356,bipolar,Today I put my mental health first.,"My boss called me today asking if I'd like more hours. I asked him questions about the times and locations. After much thought and review of my current schedule, I turned him down. 

Learning what I can handle and what will trigger an emotional and mental breaking point is a huge step for me. I've always been the one to want to please everyone and make life easier for others. But I've come to realize a lot of that was at a personal cost. I would be drained, exhausted, and putting a toll on my own health. 

Being able to say no, made me feel strong. Strong enough to stand up for myself. And my boss took it well. He even offered to find me more work that would fit my schedule. I'm thankful for my job and an understanding boss. I'm glad I finally had enough nerve to say no."

31358,bipolar,How did you know when you needed to increase your meds?,"How did you know when you’re at a good level? I’m at 100mg of Lamictal and it’s definitely helped stabilize my moods and slow down my chaotic, intrusive thoughts. It’s even helped my OCD and tremors. 

I still feel pretty depressed and I have episodes where I’m struggling to want to hang onto life. But I’m not sure how much of it is my environment (which isn’t great) and what’s my brain.

I texted him to ask if he had just came in. And he hadn't. He came by in a hurry and took a screwdriver and checked the whole house. No one was here. I asked my coworkers if there was noise similar at the end of the conference call. Nothing. I've had similar but less vivid episodes in the past. This was so real and a part of me isn't convinced it didn't happen. I haven't had an issue in almost a year. I thought I was getting better. I finally got on the right meds. And now I'm terrified and crying. I just want this to be over. I thought I could trust myself again. Thank you for letting me vent.

He used to beat me to a pulp, for any reason any time of the day, now he is a pacifist. I was pretty calm back then, and now fight MMA and Muay Thai. Oh how time changes you.

I live alone on the other side of the country from all my family and friends. No one cares about me here and I'm all alone. I feel afraid to be alone. In the hospital I had people to talk to and people cared about me. If I was crying/ had anxiety/ having a panic attack I would get the help I needed. I got fed, they made sure i took my meds regularly, and I had a safe cozy place to sleep where they checked on me every 15 minutes. I liked knowing I couldn't hurt myself and no one could hurt me. Now im back alone crying filled with anxiety and wanting to hurt myself again. I dont feel safe anymore and it is really hard. How do I transition back to my normal life where I dont even feel safe with myself and am VERY alone?"
31370,bipolar,Anyone get worse when increasing Lamictal? Fidgety and restless,"I’ve been on Lamictal 150 for a little over a year now. Not sure if it really helped much, if at all. Recently my doctor decided to up the dosage.

We went straight up to 225 and I felt dizzy so we stopped. I decided to try it again but slower this time. So I went up to 175mg. In this time period I had a hard time sitting still and felt very fidgety for a few days. Although this could simply be my regular problem(my symptoms tend to change a lot ). 

This subsided and I moved up to 200mg a day with no problem for a full week. Last night however I got agitated and had racing thoughts. Today I have had extreme restlessness (fidgeting etc) and just feel plain awful. Extreme inner tension 

It just seems worse than usual. I know I should get off Reddit and call my doctor but I feel so alone. Im also scared these are just my normal symptoms and I’m mistaken it for the increase in my meds. 

Has anyone gotten worse on this drug."

31373,bipolar,HELP how do i get the paranoia and voices to stop?,"the paranoia and voices will not stop today. i know there is no cure to BP and episodes will always happen. i’m being treated with meds (gabapentin, lamictal, and wellbutrin). i’ve tried to drown it out with music and showering, but even then i still can hear the voices which pushes me into greater paranoia. i also have a terrible smell of my dead dog that died over a week ago. it smells so bad in my house, but it’s been fully cleaned (bleach, essential oils, candles, incense, sage) and the smell won’t go away. i think the smell might be part of this delusion?? my mania is real bad at the moment. i hundreds today at ross and was there for many hours to “relax,” impulsively dyed my
hair black today, had a 10 hour sex marathon with a tinder hookup yesterday, decided to cook a 3 course diner for myself today after not eating for however long, i’m self employed and have been unable to stay focused long enough to work for over a week now, i’ve been sleeping 3-5 hours a night, hearing the voices again and they’ve been talking to me for days now, but right now the paranoia and voices are hitting so bad.

recreational weed is legal where i’m at, and i use it when i’m not manic, but knowing that i’m currently manic, weed has a greater likelihood of pushing me into deeper paranoia rather than it’s joyful sedating affects.

31374,bipolar,Generalized anxiety and BP I,"(Not feeling well and looking for some external validation here ...)

So I scrolled through a bunch of posts with ""Cipralex/Lexapro"" in them... I guess I'm just asking if anyone has ever been on Lithium at the same time as this SSRI before?... Preferably you share my GAD and BP I diagnoses.

Some context:

I've felt like shit on and off since my last (really bad) manic episode which was 4 years ago, with little ""ups"" here and there that I managed to curb with extra medication.

When I was first diagnosed with anxiety as a teen I was given Cipralex, and I felt ""symptom-free"" or like myself for almost a year. Then I had my first manic episode that was bad enough for people to noticed and I wound up hospitalized.

Essentially I'm starting university again, and it's my final year. I was on Latuda for half of last year but absolutely could not manage the physical side effects at all... It was horrific. I had to quit it and went back to feel very anxious and disorganized and depressed.

I caved and my doctor suggested I try Cipralex again. It's been almost 8 years since I was on it. My main concern is becoming manic again... Even though I know that without any antidepressant and just on Lithium  obviously I still have the potential to cycle.

TLDR: I need reassurance that for my condition I will feel okay, and that it will be ""safer"" this time because I am older, know myself better, and am taking a mood stabilizer in conjunction with Cipralex."

32978,bipolar,"Differentiating between circumstantial and physiological depression, useful coping strategy.","I thought I’d share a coping strategy that moved my depression line up.  As I sink into a depressive episode, sometimes I recognize a trigger and sometimes it’s just a gradual thing.  Suppose I loose someone, go through a break up, loose a job or go through another significant transition I know the darkness is coming.  I take a proactive approach to embracing the depression.  That means I know I’m gonna let my habits slip, smoking relapse, poor AF diet, dirty house, bad hygiene.  I say ok fuck it, let all go right now, I decide to get depressed, I say three weeks.  I’ve got three weeks, circumstance I can’t change, I’m so down, I’m powerless to poor coping tools (old vices, depression reinforcing habits, serious damaging self neglect) so I just kinda go for it, my boundary is alcohol (it double down the physiology of depression.  But three weeks, I’m off the hook for most self neglect, I don’t take any shame in feeling like shit, I don’t expect myself to do anything, but basically weigh me down and I do a few things not to feed it.   

Admitting, going for it, embracing it, minimizing damage has given me the idea that I can bounce off rock bottoms.  

It’s when I can’t see a trigger, like I can’t admit something or some shame is too much to bear, so I hole up in denial with out realizing it.  That’s when the habits go to complete shit and the rancid physiology wins and I think about suicide for months on end without the slightest feeling of control.  It feels like I’m the victim of a horrible disease and I should just check out early. 

tl;dr,  triggers get you down, falling powerless to poor coping is understandable as hell, but entrenches you the physiological nightmare that is depression, my tip is frontload the shitty habits, call it self care, do the worst, then decide you’re gonna go the other way, get meds, reach out, drink a ton of water like you’re life depends on it, and dodge getting stuck in the worst.

I’m not saying it’s easy at all, took me 15 years to get this pattern dialed.  Works here and there, nothing is fool proof, it’s life.

Anybody grown into anything like this?"

I want to check in again but my attempts today have had no response. I noticed this past week that Fred seemed fairly withdrawn. We spent most of the day together yesterday, during which time he seemed off and he expressed he felt empty. My concern comes from the fact that through mutual friends and a roommate I found out he hasn't contacted anyone all day. His roommate expressed concern because he had been playing loud music and didn't reply when he knocked. I don't think he would do anything rash but because I have been there I worry. He does have days where he shuts the world out as a kind of a recharge, but I worry because this would the second time he has done it in a short window. I want to be there but I'm not sure if I should push or give him space. He is a big part of my life so I want to be there for him and if anything happened to him it would destroy me.

32980,bipolar,Newly diagnosed: parenting?,"Hey ya'll, so I was diagnosed last week with rapid cycling BP and UEPD and it's made the week since quite introspective (also I can't stop singing A7X's Welcome to the Family). 

Myself (28F) and my partner (27M) are at that point where we are really gearing up to have children. But my siblings and I had (have) a f***ing awful relationship with our mother, who we all - and my Dr too - think has undiagnosed BP. 

I'm now getting quite worried that a) I'm going to pass this on to my kids and b) it's impossible to have a healthy bipolar parent-child relationship. 

Honestly when I think about it I feel like I'm going to be Edward Scissorhands, not wanting to but just causing damage by existing.. yikes that's a dark thought to follow, ok.

Please, has anybody got anything anecdotal or advice from a healthy bipolar parent-child relationship? It can't all bad, right?"

32982,bipolar,Anyone else on the bipolar spectrum experience postcoital dysphoria (post-sex sadness)!,"B1, Early 20s, F. 
This seems to be unavoidable for me with my last 3-4 partners. The sex is great, with all desires fulfilled, but afterwards I feel terrible. Empty and withdrawn. 

With one of them I full blown cried after. Since the last one, it’s a day later and I still feel completely hallow. The sex was great! I was satisfied many times! Not being in a relationship with any of them could be a psychological factor for me, but my total detachment afterwards has resulted in me ghosting all partners and I’m afraid this one is next. 

After a little bit of research, supposedly the high that comes from sex uses us up so much of those feel-good brain chemicals (serotonin, dopamine) that you can come down hard from it. Perhaps even more so with a mental illness that already has a chemically imbalanced brain? I’m medicated for my B1 and I’ve taken all my meds on time, yet I am still feeling like this. 

Can anyone relate?"

I don't know what resources online are good and stuff, so it's kind of an information overload and a lot of the overly scientific stuff is..incredibly hard for me to understand. So if anyone has resources that explain these things in a way that I could understand I'd really, really appreciate it."
32984,bipolar,Starting a new job. Scared I'm going to screw it up. [General],"So yeah. It's at a grocery store, nothing glamorous. But it's been a year since I've had a real job (I'm a college student and my parents mostly support me financially) and I'm hella nervous. Every single job I've ever had has ended with me fucking it up some way, usually not very far into it. Maybe it's because I couldn't get out of bed to make it to work, maybe I did something impulsive and stupid that got me fired. Maybe I blow up at my boss. Whatever. 

The longest I've had a job has been three months, and I really want this to be different. I feel like I'm in a good place right now for the most part; my meds are working well for me (except for the bupropion which is supposed to help me focus, but I've noticed no difference). I think I can do this, but I'm riddled with a lot of doubt. I feel a lot of shame that such a simple entry-level job is probably going to be harder for me than a fucking engineering job (or something) for normal people. I have to keep a good poker face too because  I can't let my boss know any of this.

I was so exhausted/sedated with this combination after a few days I completely stopped the geodon since it was the medication sedating me. I simply don't have time and nor was it safe for me to be taking that. 
Well, almost three weeks ago, I took myself off of lithium due to how much it messed up my gastrointestinal (diarrhea everyday as just one example) and put me in a permanent mixed episode. 

My question to you folks, is there any mood stabilizing medication you have been on that has not sedated you?
I absolutely refuse to be on anything that is going to make me so tired that I need to go to bed within an hour. I have a full time job, a family and am working on my graduate degree so I have to be functional and I would rather be manic than be driving or interacting with clients, half asleep. 
I'm hoping someone has had better luck than me with this.

I had a hypomania episode of one week in the middle of the current depression episode (6 months in or more). It was clearly a hypomania episode because my libido skyrocketed out of nowhere, after 2 years on zero, for one week, then it was gone. I believe I had hypomania episodes before, but can’t be so sure. 

I work a very stressful job and know stress is a risk factor for episodes. Am I going to be able to work a stressful job after the meds kick in? Should I consider finding something less stressful in the benefit of long term health? Bipolar took a lot from my mother, I am afraid of the future."

This post is about something I’ve talked to my therapist about a lot recently. I’m a 26F, diagnosed bipolar II around a year and a half ago, and, after some trial and error, have been stabilized on lamictal for the past 8 months. My symptoms started around age 16, but I had parents who were of the “you’re a teenager you’ll grow out of it” mentality. I began using substances heavily, self harming, not sleeping or eating for days, isolating etc. Fast forward to my early/mid 20s, and I had a suicide attempt after being misdiagnosed and put on SSRIs. That’s when I got serious about getting better, and finally ended up on meds that worked and stayed committed to therapy. 

As I got better, part of that process turned out to involve a lot of self reflection. I started to think back on the things I’d done and the people I’d hurt when I was at my sickest, and it turned to be one of the most horrible/cringey parts of recovering. I’d failed miserably in friendships, wasted stupid amounts of money, got shitty tattoos...y’all know the drill. I remember being so manic at a party that I interrupted the entire thing to make an announcement about how much I loved everyone. People assumed I was wasted but I hadn’t had anything to drink. 

The worst behavior was in my ltr. I had been married to a man for several years who was the most incredible, generous, compassionate person who stuck with me through absolutely everything. I treated him like garbage. I berated him, pressured him into paying for everything, cheated on him, lied to him, and when he was finally ready to leave for good I’d beg for him back. It’s very disturbing to think back on. 

Since then I’ve apologized to him and I’m in a really healthy relationship with my current partner, but I can’t help have flashbacks to my shitty abusive and generally stupid actions while my bipolar was completely unmanaged. It’s like a recovering alcoholic slowly recalling cringey things they did while they were drinking. 

I’m curious, do any of you deal with the guilt/shame from past bipolar behaviors? How do you all deal? What are your experiences with it? My therapist talks a lot about how it’s impossible to hold yourself responsible for actions you did while you were in an altered state of mind, and it’s time for self forgiveness. I understand that intellectually but emotionally it’s hard to do. 

I also want to add, the way I describe my recovery sounds like an easy linear process, and it wasn’t, nor is it for other people. I applaud people who are at all stages of the bipolar disorder journey, because there are many steps backward and forward. Proud of you :)"
34644,bipolar,Quick question on Denial,"It’s a quick question. Recently I’ve been denying that I have BD and convincing myself to not see a doctor, logically I know I have it but mentally frustrated as I keep saying to myself I don’t.

36290,bipolar,How do you keep up with chores?,I work at least 40 hours a week and just got promoted to a management position so I’m constantly tired or don’t want to do anything when I come home. Every week I take one day to clean everything but it gets extremely overwhelming. There have been weeks lately where I won’t clean at all because I don’t want to move on my days off. How do you keep up with cleaning and laundry? Do you have a schedule for yourself or a way to make it more enjoyable?
36294,bipolar,So I'm apparently bipolar...,"Up until about three years ago, many would just attribute my moodiness to some niche attribute of autism, and then in around 2017 when I got a new job I was hoping I'd like, I fell into a noticeably deep depression that was unseen in me since before I transitioned from male to female. What ended it was some kind of break in my attitude towards the world, and I became fed up with the mundane way I was living, and so I embarked on what I saw at the time as a sort of adventure.

I met another trans woman online through whom I met several more other trans women, and then due to our shared negative experiences we all sort of pulled together into a weird sort of polyamorous relationship. A bunch of them were into various drugs, mostly psychedelics, which I eventually got a hold of through them. Disappointed by the boring state of my life, I enduldged in LSD, mushrooms, and ketamine every weekend and sometimes week nights until by mid spring 2018 I would have paranoid delusions about being stuck in a time loop or that I was turning into one of the women I was dating up until just then, and I would fear that those things might be the case even when I was stone cold sober. Worried that there was no escape from this mess, I began wondering if the only way out was suicide.

At around this time I met yet another girl who had recently transitioned. I was first person she had ever dated, or even kissed for that matter, and because she was so sweet and yet also very monogamous, I left the others to be with her. She and her family would invite me and some of their friends over to her family's house for drinks, and I would always end up drinking too much, sometimes confessing my delusions and suicidal ideation. It was through theses experiences I learned that the girl I was now with (I'll call her Marla because she continues to be relevant and is still my present girlfriend) had recently lost her best friend to suicide, and I'd witness her break down in tears over this on several occasions. There was an instance where after hearing the full story behind his death while nearly blackout drunk, I became so upset I went into a self-injurious rage where I ended up leaving a big nasty bruise on my forehead the next day.

Over all of this I began feeling depressed again, and seeing the negative effects my drug usage was having on me she convinced me to put it down at least until I recovered. I became quite depressed for about the next half year, or into early spring next year. Most days I couldn't even get out of bed, and I ended up getting fired from my job. This sent me overboard and I began seriously contemplating hanging myself. However after having seen the heartbreak it caused my girlfriend to lose her best friend to suicide, I instead told my doctor and got put in inpatient care and they prescribed me SSRIs, which worked on my depression until I got a new job a few months ago and I learned that here in the US Bernie Sanders announced he was dropping from the presidential race in favor of Joe Biden, and in the midst of a devastating pandemic no less (for those unfamiliar, Sanders platform was healthcare and taxing the rich, something we desperately need in this country).

It was here I became outraged and decided that my life needed some kind of meaning. If our government can't do what it's supposed to, then I'll do it myself. I joined our local socialist organization and got to work. I became zealous, and there was so much going on: riots breaking out, guillotines being erected, right wing terrorists working with cops to shoot protesters, it was madness! I felt revolution was at our doorstep, and that I should lead it. I saw myself as the ideological successor to Lenin himself, and started pushing my comrades until they noticed something was off. The decided to give me a ""time-out"" so to speak, and I broke out into a psychotic episode that ended with my girlfriend restraining me and my computer monitors smashed.

After that I became paranoid my comrades were plotting to dispose of me, and I became obsessively occupied by this until at work I suddenly started hallucinating that the lights were changing color, and I became so disoriented I couldn't find the bathroom. At that moment, my boss decided I needed to be sent home on sick leave because I was clearly not ""all there.""

 I had almost gotten fired again, but instead took this opportunity to see my doctor and get some tests done. Turns out I was bipolar this whole time, and SSRIs were causing psychosis in me. So now I'm on anticonvulsant mood stabilizers and am trying to avoid going crazy. I eventually went back into work, and made amends with my comrades. Things are kinda normal now, but I can tell it's kinda being forced by my meds. I've yet to experience the long term effects of them. I was kinda hoping I'd just be depressed and that I'd recover, but apparently bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition so I'm kinda stuck with it. Oh well."

36297,bipolar,Manic Oil Painting? Is medication worth the side effects?,"I've been following this page for a while without having an account but I made this painting while manic and I thought I should share it and explain its meaning! I'm an artist and I've been working on a series about what I think emotions and memories would look like interacting on a microscopic level if they were alive. This particular painting is about a manic episode becoming engulfed by depression and anxiety and the struggle that the two have during mixed episodes. I've been having issues with my bipolar for years but I only got diagnosed and started medication and such about 6 months ago. It was really wonderful how much medication helped me, but I've been off of them for a few weeks now because the new medication I was put on made me have seizures. Is it worth it to try to go on without medication? Or will it make life harder for me in the long run. I'm already having frightening thoughts, deep depression, and strong irritability, but it seems that the process of finding a medication can be just awful. I'm 21 and I feel like maybe I should go back to living with my parents because all of this has been so frightening. Do any of y'all exist without medication and if so do you have any recommendations or tips?

36303,bipolar,Adding antidepressant to mood stabilizer?,"So obviously I know this isn’t the place for official psychiatric advice, but I’d like to know the experiences of people here who’ve added an antidepressant on to a mood stabilizer.

I’ve been on 75mg Lamictal for 2 years and it evened me out so much; my moods weren’t as labile and I got a lot of relief from that crushing intensity. 

Buuuut the world being how it is lately, my anxiety is terrible and I wake up every morning angry, stressed out and depressed. I’m very obsessive and hard on myself right now, and it’s difficult to get stuff done.

My friend who’s also on Lamictal recently added 5mg Lexapro to her med schedule and she said it helped greatly with the anxiety, plus she’s not as hard on herself.

I’ve been pretty cautious/skeptical about meds all my life (took a year to finally agree to the mood stabilizer) and try to manage my lifestyle first, before going in for the chemical adjustment. But given that I’m doing everything “right” and still feel shitty, it might be time for me to throw in the towel and add something.

(I don’t want to go up on the Lamictal because it makes me feel faded and dumb as hell.)

Like I said, obviously gonna talk to my psychiatrist about this, but I would love to hear from anyone who’s done a similar adjustment and whether they had a good/bad/eh experience."
36304,bipolar,I’m giving up drinking... and I know it’s what’s best 😞,"I’m diagnosed bipolar and it sucks. Even on medication it doesn’t fix everything. I love drinking, not excessively, but I love a good buzz. I started noticing a spiral or extreme down after drinking. It wasn’t always depression. It was a mix between a manic episode, a depressive episode, or a full breakdown. The more and more it’s happened my boyfriend has noticed and started to try and plan around it. He is BEYOND supportive, but it is hard for him to see. He would first start by being vocal about my drinking, he next would try and reduce my drinking, lastly he said he didn’t want to be around because he knows he can’t help. It’s hard because he’s right, and I love him, I don’t want him to feel that way of feeling helpless when trying to handle my episodes. It’s very hard. I don’t enjoy having episodes, and now that I know more of my trigger I know what I need to do to stop. It’s becoming harder the more I realize that I need to do it. I’m going to miss a good buzz when I’ve had a hard week to help forget things. I’m not going to completely quit drinking, but I’ll iron out my plan soon. I’m thinking if I drink it’ll be one, but it’ll need more rules for me if I’m going to make it work and stay in a healthy way. 

TL;DR - I’m giving up drinking for my mental health, because bipolar disorder sucks!"

Hey guys, sorry to come back with another depressing post. 

I have ran into a problem, I self harmed for the first time in 5 years and can’t stop. My family saw the other day and threatened to send me to the hospital again.

While this option might seem helpful on the surface because I am very suicidal, it didn’t help the last time. I also would more than likely fail my classes and lose my job if I went into the hospital. 

I just feel like I have no where to turn. I already see a therapist and a psychiatrist, but every time I mention how badly I’m doing everyone threatens the hospital. It’s like everyone thinks I’m too far gone and that is the only option.

I don’t know what to do. I need some serious help but don’t know what else to do to get it."

36310,bipolar,Addicted to Chaos,"I am an alcoholic with type 1 bipolar disorder. Like many alcoholics, I had a pretty traumatic childhood, and I have used various substances throughout my life to escape. I have lived a life of suicidal lows and highs that literally feel as if I have been imbued with the powers of a god. I have experienced abuse, unstable housing, poverty, and psychosis throughout my life. I thrive when I feel like I am about to be squashed from existence by the violence of the world. When everything is crumbling around me, I can always hustle to make it work. I feel certain of my resourcefulness, resilience, and cunning. I know that I am a survivor. The problem is, I don't know what to do with myself when life feels calm. I only feel motivation when the consequence is that I literally might not survive. In the past, I have relapsed because I feel ""bored"". Everything feels too easy. The highs aren't high enough, the lows aren't low enough, the fights aren't bad enough, there is no palpable cosmic energy hanging so thick in the air that I can almost taste it. I don't know who I am outside of chaos. In moments of chaos I am reminded on a very primal level that I am me and that my tenacity is the only thing keeping me alive. When everything is calm, I almost feel as if I have no ego at all. I lose sight of my passion, I lose my creative spark, I forget that I can use my own will to change and transform the world around me. I sometimes feel as if I have literally no drive at all, that nothing would keep me from laying in bed and staring at the ceiling forever. I really like things that are intense because intensity is familiar to me. I also know this mentality will lead me to an early grave. I want to learn to exist in the calm. I want to stop living a life where I only respond to the chaos and mess around me. I want to feel in control at all times, not only when my wellbeing is threatened. I know that I am addicted to alcohol, and have been physically dependent on it for much of my life, but much of this addiction is rooted in the chaos it creates in my life. I want to know if anyone else has felt the same way and what they have done to change it. I don't want to live like this anymore, but I don't even know how to begin to feel comfortable in the moments when things are actually working. Thanks."
36312,bipolar,Really need an experienced bipolar friend to talk to?,I really wish right now I had a bipolar friend to talk ti right now :(
36313,bipolar,Should I be pushing myself more?,"Basically I haven't been myself for quite some years now. Ever since I had a breakdown (I think) in college and dropped out, everything's been downhill. I tried several times to pull myself together - took on some jobs, got into a (rather selective) training program, but I just seemed to be fucking those up too. When I got diagnosed with bipolar it seemed like my life finally made sense, and I started treatment and therapy.

It's been two years now. While I do think I'm perhaps handling my emotions in a slightly better way, I still don't feel up to rejoining society. I did some freelance work (my friends are very helpful and I'm truly grateful to them for that), but though I did manage to complete the jobs, I had been so anxious and doubted myself so much during the process that I really can't handle more of it.

But here's the thing, am I being to complacent? I don't want to be the sort of person who uses her illness as a shield to justify being lazy. My doctor says that I should take small steps. I think I'm taking small steps? I try to read the books I half-finished (and did finish reading some), I write (though not very well), I watch movies on my to-watch list, I'm trying to be a better player in my DND compaigns... but these things... to put it frankly, do not bring in money. I'm not even sure they're productive.

Economically my family is stable and I am an only child, and I guess I can mooch off my parents for some years until I become a fully functioning person again. Still, that's not something I want to do. To be honest, the guilt is killing me (not in an explicit, suicidal-thoughts type of way).

So should I try to get out of my comfort zone? I'm not actually sure how I should proceed, but should I stop relying on my negative emotions and try to... do something I guess?

(I think these are things I need to tell my doctor, but I won't be seeing her until next week at least.)"
36314,bipolar,MONDAY MORNING THOUGHTS,I am in my mid twenties and I feel young but old at the same time if that even makes sense. My friends are getting married and having kids and I’m not even dating anyone. I feel like with quarantine and everything I actually enjoy my own company. I do wonder if someone will ever be able to love me for me episodes and all. My question to you all is how do you date with being bipolar? When do you tell the person you’re dating?
37985,bipolar,"Recently diagnosed. Is it common to believe close friends have started to dislike you, so you push them away, only to later realize your thoughts were irrational?","This happens from time to time with me. I'll get convinced that people very close to me dislike me, and I'll focus on times I feel excluded, and just use it to form this narrative in my head that they hate me.

So while this is going on in my brain, they think everything is totally normal and they love me.

And I have been known to completely distance myself and leave those groups because I'll think they're the ones distancing.

And when I finally get a clear head no the later, I just realize I've pushed awua people I loved and that loved me. And it keeps happening, so eventually, I'm probably going to be alone.

Is this common with bipolar? Is that a manic episode? A depressive one?"
37986,bipolar,I need a bipolar gf,"Not fishing in this subreddit. It's just something I desire. Last gf got me in trouble for sexual repulsion. Was happy when I was manic and even tried to trigger it even though I was on meds. I need someone that actually knows the necessity of depression and the highs of mania. My last girlfriend had something that I never want to be around again. I won't say cause she tore my fucking head off for even mentioning her existence to this subreddit. 

I'm sick of her threatening to get a restraining order, talking massive shit about me behind my back and calling me crazy. She is actually so mean,so cruel, so childish. I can't take it anymore. She keeps triggering my mania in such bad ways."
37987,bipolar,Just another manic Sunday,"Today’s Events Include: two hours of sleep, no food just water and Gatorade, three new songs on guitar, two new 3 hour playlists, three new collages and four hours of sifting through materials like newspaper and magazines, and then finished the night with an half and hour of skating (working on my manual). 

Be safe, kiddos. At least I didn’t spend any money."
37988,bipolar,Question from a newb,"Sooooo. Last night I decided sleep wasn’t needed and spending money on video games was. I slept 2 hours and felt fine today. I also blew like a ton of cash on useless video game pixels, which I normally don’t do (I’m usually frugal as hell). Tonight I’m not sleepy either. I unlinked my credit card from my game account though to stop the hemorrhaging. 

Thing is, I feel normal. I can recognize the fact I’m acting differently but mentally I just feel like me. I got diagnosed bipolar 2 with mixed states a couple years ago and while I certainly noticed the suicidal lows, I could never spot the highs. The concept of hypomania didn’t make sense to me somehow. It’s only recently I started thinking maybe the occasional not needing sleep or unusual behavior sprees might actually be a sign something is wrong. So I wanted to ask you lovely folks what you experience when hypomanic. Does anyone else spend cash they don’t have? Not need sleep? Feel basically just fine but acting strangely? Thanks!"

But if you do... we're on the same boat.

A long time ago I started paying attention to how my behaviors changed after watching the news. To fuck up a little more I am a Journalist and it's so much heavier when you have a sense of what is happening around you than people who just keep living like nothing bad is ever gonna happen in their homes.

Unfortunately I'm living in hell...I mean Brazil. This was supposed to be a happy and prosperous country but WTF happened to Brazilian people???? It feels like everybody is crazy... really, CRAZY!

First they put that fucking asshole to be president and now they don't even recognize that people are dying like it was NOTHING. 

I came up with the conclusion that people here don't consider themselves as Brazilian...it's always like ""my grandma is from Italy"", ""my grandpa is from Portugal"" so everyone think that they are not from here WTFFFFF.

That's enough for them not to take care of our country as they should. I won't include myself cause fuck that bullshit...I'm not like this at all.

But when I watch the news and everything that I affirmed that would happen 2 years ago is happening now...I get so angry and I start overthinking untill I have no energy left so I get sad. 

I start worrying about my future and not being able to get a job that will pay me enough to make a living cause I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and sometimes things are harder to pull through and people around just don't get it. 

I start worrying about people I love. I start worrying about my relationship cause we may have arguing moments because of money...and of course no one will accept that I simply can't get any job just to have money cause I'll start getting depressed and suddenly I'm in hospital again cause I did something that I shouldn't.

One thing leads to another and I must say that right now I watch the news just when someone around me is watching so I don't have ways to scape. I'm aware of everything that's happened cause in social media you can't control everything you see but the thing is that government doesn't worth my sanity and health.

I wish I could believe that someday things will be better but I don't want to get frustrated. Seriously my goal right now is to pack up everything and go make a living in New Zealand. But I love my country (I do, but this fucking government doesn't) and I don't think I'd be happy in another place of the earth... seriously Brazil deserves more."

I've gotten on lamotrogine?? (Sorry I'm shit at spelling) and its helped a lot, and I think I'm like. A lot more normal in my cycles, they're not remotely as severe, but they take FOREVER.  when I was hypo it was cool, I was busting out art and making good money on it to boot, and it lasted a whole month which is unheard for me.

Type of depression in the most exhausting of ways. And I know dropping my mess suddenly is not the answer andt I know it'll turn into either mania or a mixed episode(more likey in my track record) and I really. Want that. And I have no idea why.

38000,bipolar,Seroquel causing anger issues?,"A few years back I was taking 800mg Seroquel XR (I have bipolar 1). It worked great for stabilising my moods but I stopped taking it after a while because I experienced too many unpleasant side effects. One of the worst was that it made me *so angry* all the time. Like, no patience, irritable as fuck, and snapping over the smallest things. Im a single mum of 2 young kids, so life can get frustrating enough as it is and I couldn't handle being even more irritable. 

Since switching to lithium I no longer felt any of that, and was back to my normal self - I have a short temper in general but im normally pretty good at controlling my emotions. However, I recently started taking seroquel again in small doses to help me sleep. Only 50mg to 100mg, depending on how bad my insomnia was. Since then I have definitely noticed my temper becoming more unmanageable and I'm having to put serious effort into not snapping at my kids or losing my shit at others. 

Has anyone else ever experienced this? I've googled and it doesn't really come up as a common side effect. Im starting to get paranoid that maybe im just an asshole. Any input would be really appreciated."

I'm meant to start at 50mg, see how I feel next day, and if not too sedated, take two the next day for 100mg. We have a follow up on September 1st.

I've been going to her since march 2019. I previously was also on risperidone 2mg but I don't remember that doing much of anything, and I didn't take it for long and there was a gap when I just said ""to hell with all this"" and kept up with my topamax but went back to just my weed otherwise.

With this pandemic, my moods, my depression, my anxiety, my sleep, everything has gotten beyond my therapist's help even with increase in attendance. But even when I started feeling better, I feel the medications are causing issues.

I'm going to give this one a try, going to take it every night at 8:30pm, track my feelings, but I feel like everything she gives me is bringing me lower and down. The decrease of the lexapro significantly helped by a TON. I'd kill for an UP, for once. I'd kill for some energy. I'm hoping this helps 🙏"
38009,bipolar,impulsivity causing me problems,"Do you guys have impulse problems when you are not manic or hypomanic at all? I have problems with things like binge eating, spending money, and feeling like I want to message people for a variety of reasons. But that is just every day...

How have you been able to curb impulsivity? 

My doctor is starting me at a really low dose of prozac to help and I am really crossing my fingers it does. My counsellor and I have a few phrases that I think about when I am wanting to do something like ""any email worth sending tonight is worth sending tomorrow."" Luckily when it comes to money I have some safeguards in place.

I feel like I have made some big mistakes in 2020 and I want to be more in control.

39708,bipolar,Just read up on Lamictal. Scary shit man.,"If anyone tried to get me to take that shit I would throw them out a window. An anti-convulsant that causes tremors? A skin rash that can be life threatening? Confusion, muscle aches, random bleeding, jaundice and much more. Can someone taking it explain their experience with it cause from what I read it seems like a pharmaceutical nightmare.

Sorry if it works for you guys but count me out. Im cool with Seroquel."
39709,bipolar,I’m in mixed episode hell. Looking for tips from those who suffer similarly.,"Diagnosis: BP1, ultra rapid cycler with mixed episodes.    **Extreme** anxiety disorder.  Not on psych meds anymore except for clonopin because I’ve tried them ALL, nothing works, and the side effects were impossible (anyone have tardive dyskinesia?!).  I have four kinds of CBD flower that can *sometimes* snap me out of an episode, and about to try microdosing psylocibin.  Rarely drink, but love sugar.  Covid weight gain of 25 pounds since March.  Yay.  

Today has been HELL.  I’m at a point right now where I can post which is sort of an improvement but usually this means I’m on my way to a hypomanic episode.  

Background: teacher in SF Bay Area.  Started school last week, full DL - it SUCKS.  I’m in a great supportive district, great school, great students.  Doesn’t matter cuz my issues don’t stem from outside things... it’s the inside brain shit.  Oh and am currently on TOTAL lockdown in an air conditioned house (praise the gods) because I’m surrounded by fires and the air quality is purple... and I’m asthmatic.  

This morning I struggled through a HORRID depressive episode... was trying to figure out to hospitalize myself and still do distant teaching because I can NOT jeopardize my career/job.  Magical thinking anyone?!  Suicidally depressed, but did make it from the bed to the sofa and managed to feed the animals.  Cried for hours.  

Finally, about an hour ago, was like “Welp, through that... all better now!  Let’s cook!”  I hate cooking.  Let’s walk the dog! Asthmatic can’t breathe, did it anyway.  Paid the price though.  

Now bouncing on the sofa, full of energy but with a horrible headache and dinner on the stove.  

I know what’s coming... another crash.  The only reason I don’t kill myself when I get that bad is because it would destroy my adult son.  But sometimes even that feels like it’s not enough.  The feeling of “I’m just nothing” is so shitty.  But it’s even hard to feel too sad cuz I can’t feel anything.  

So, thanks for getting this far... any **rapid** cyclers out there?  Desperate for tips. Obviously exercise is out of the question due to air quality.  I have to prep for tomorrow’s Zoom class meeting somehow.  Haha!!!I doubt there’s much anyone can offer but I just have to throw this out to the Redditverse.  You’re all heroes."
39710,bipolar,I stopped my meds for too long and now I’m restarting them but I don’t feel right,"I’m on 200mg Lamotrigine and, I’ll be honest, it doesn’t help with my psychosis-like symptoms. Honestly the only thing it does for me is help with my anger and anxiety. Not complaining but, ya know, I wish it helped with the depression and psychosis.

Anyway, I keep getting a “voice” in my head telling me whether I should take my meds. I think it’s God honestly. For almost 3 weeks it told me not to. Why did I listen to it? Great question. I’m scared not to. Whenever I don’t listen to the voice, bad things happen. 

Alright I’m back to writing this because I mean as I wrote that I just hallucinated some shit in the corner of my room and had to center myself

Anyway again I stop taking the meds because it said to. Now it told me to take them again but,,, I think it triggered a manic episode? and now I won’t stop being paranoid. I literally can’t sleep right now because for some reason I feel like I’m gonna have a nightmare or sleep paralysis. But I need to sleep or else I’m gonna hallucinate more. There’s a weird triangular demon wolf thing in the corner of my room that keeps moving towards me everytime I look away...  If I fuck up typing somethgng it’s because I have to look at ti every few seconds so it goes awY 

I hate my brain this isn’t fair rant over gonna listen to ASMR and hide under the sheets 



also you know what pisses me off how come all of you are so good at art? here and on r/psychosis that’s not fair but I really like the art you guys post it’s very cool !!! 

ok gonna throw something at this bitch in the corner because he’s starting to piss me off"
39711,bipolar,I opt out of this roller coaster,"It’s not fun anymore, truth be told it never was. If life is gonna continue to be the way it’s been I’m not down for that. I’m medicated and sober.

This is my last shot, if things don’t work out I’m gonna respectfully peace out from this world"
39712,bipolar,How would you personify your bipolar if it was a person?,"This was something my therapist had asked me a while back and I had been thinking back on it deeply. My response was basically like my bipolar being this needy toddler, I could be doing something fairly important such as my homework, a work schedule or even doing something at work and I could just get a ""tug"" on my pant leg with a toddler telling me that they refuse to keep going with whatever task is at hand. This is what infuriate me the most because one of the main things that keeps me stable and happy is just being productive, just moving day to day, getting chores left and right done. So to have a toddler having a meltdown in the middle of the dishes or an angry fit in the library or loudly playing at 1am is so debilitating.   


This will be something I touch back on when I see my therapist next, but what is everyone else's idea of who their bipolar would be?"
39713,bipolar,Does anyone have episodes when on meds?,"On 300 mg Seroquel and when big shit happens I go manic to the tits. Gf left me, fucked a mate and then I moved twice in a month plus new uni.

I really want a relationship and some intimacy again, especially after being so deprived of human contact this year. I got the opportunity to but I'm afraid I'm gonna mess up and end up hurting them.

39717,bipolar,Will my meds eventually stop working?,"I’ve been on a depakote and risperidone mix for a year and they seem to be working and I feel stable.

If so what are some things to do and look out for if this happens."
39718,bipolar,Lithium and heart palpitations?,"Since starting lithium it seems like at times my heart is pounding out of my chest and slightly elevated. It’s not beating super fast it’s just very noticeable and like palpitations it’s usually disconcerting. Before anyone says it I am gonna ask my psychiatrist about this when I talk to her on the phone tomorrow. Just wanted to know if anyone else experiences this and if it’s “normal”.

I will say I also drink probably what would be considered a sort of high amount of caffeine (3 - 4 Cups a day, plus diet soda maybe half a liter) and I also smoke cigarettes all day long). I can’t tell what it is. The lithium and the coffee and cigarettes seem to make it worse together, it wasn’t this bad with just the coffee. I am a huge hypochondriac so my minds going to the worst places. It’s sending me into despair because the lithium has been working so well. But it’s been exponentially more noticeable when it comes on periodically."
39719,bipolar,Manic last night with (mild?) psychosis,"I've been hypomanic for weeks with occasional brief upswings into mania. I just got set up with my first dr, whom I havent brought up my past episodes with psychosis (have never brought it up to anyone before), but last night I woke up after a couple hours of sleep absolutely hyper and wired, and was convinced everyone in a mental health server was watching and monitoring me, that it wasnt safe to talk there, etc. I talked to a friend about it a bit, which kind of helped. I took some of my as needed meds which ultimately helped me sleep some more, but I also had auditory hallucinations as well... I'm doing a bit better today so far. I see my dr Thursday, but should I call tomorrow and let her know? I don't want to be bugging her but this feels like too big a thing to just not mention for 4 days... Also, what all should I do in the future if this or worse happens again? Does anyone have any advice?"

I'm frantically searching for a way to help, I do go to therapy and see a psychologist regularly, but that doesn't help me with the pain I'm feeling day to day. I feel like I can't burden anyone with how terrible I'm feeling, my family is under a lot of stress due to my mother being sick, my friends all have their own lives that they're starting, and everyone is dealing with the weight of how the world is today. I really feel like I'm losing control, but the reality of the matter is that I'm alone, I have to deal with this alone. I've tried everything I can, but no matter how much research I do, all of the resources say I need a support network to get through and that I won't be able to do it myself. Does anyone have experience with this? I am really lost and genuinely scared of how I'm feeling (not because I would harm myself, it just seems like my depression is existential, like it will never get better or go away).

I want to avoid going into mania but don’t have any real strategies on how to help myself.

39723,bipolar,Mood stabilizers that DON'T interact with weed?,"I'm not a heavy pot smoker (few times a week), I use it for my pain and muscle tension and I was recently diagnosed as BP2 (no psychotic features, relevant), though I've practically known I have it for a long time. I know a lot of people will say it's a bad idea - which I'm not decided on yet but since everyone is different, but I understand that it might not be the best as someone with BP. I just have to weigh out the pros and cons, and at the moment not being in shitty pain and having tensed up muscles is a big deal.

**The debate on whether or not it's bad aside - what are some mood stabilizers that DON'T interact with weed?** Obviously Lithium/Lamictal etc do, but I've already tried those and they (sadly) didn't work (side effects on lithium, rash on Lamictal) and I have an appointment with my doc next week. If it's relevant I use Indica heavy hybrids since I don't need the stimulation from Sativas. Thanks in advance for any help."

39727,bipolar,Hallucinations While Depressed,"Hi all,

Bit of background: I’ve been feeling really low for around 10 weeks now. Diagnosed bipolar around a month ago. This weekend has been terrible and I’ve stayed in bed the whole of the last 2 days. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm. These thoughts have been worse this weekend than ever before. I have now started seeing things out of the corner of my eyes, like dark shapes and movements in my peripheral vision. And my tinnitus has got worse, and sometimes I can hear rustling in the room. I’m not sleep deprived. The only other time I’ve experienced shadow visions was in the midst of an extreme panic attack, but I’m not in a panic attack right now. I guess I just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced these things and are they related to feeling so low/suicidal?

Thank for reading."

Ive struggled with emotional issues my entire life, which was almost always seen as hormonal or growing up issues. While ive always thought something was wrong with me. I am now in my early 20’s and have recently been diagnosed with bipolar with mania. Im struggling to cope with these facts as my mother says its a lie and they are misdiagnosing me, because im her daughter, and she would know if something was wrong. I dont doubt the doctors for i have always felt something was wrong with me. I was just wondering if anyone has any advice for me, and how to come to terms with everything?"

I don't know how to process this and understand this better. And doc said it might be bipolar because when I took an antidepressant, it gave me many symptoms including manic. I haven't experienced this anytime before.

And doc said it's not easy to say which bipolar am having. How to understand this well? And how to know sure this is bipolar? How it's like living with it?
Due to long sleep issues and fatigue I am not able to think clearly now. I read, sometimes we can't say own our own we are having this?

My issues include:
Waking up early tired and stuck,
Not able to breath well,
fatigue,
Poor hand and eye coordination,
Difficulty handling objects and work,
Tired eyes,
Tight jaws and head,
Speaking difficulty,
Confusion, poor functioning,
Memory issues

Many of this can be due to poor sleep quality right? I don't know where to start. 
Are there anyone here who's handling it without medication and is it good? Am really concerned on taking medication unless it's unavoidable.

What physical symptoms you suffer from bipolar?
What are the things, that I should be concerned with this disease in daily life? 
How do you manage it and is there any helpful resources that I may not find in google easily.

Thanks for reading, hope u all get better"
41451,bipolar,Considering paying someone to spend time with me,"I just cant take this day in and out of being all alone with my thoughts. I reach out to mental health resources , friends , random people on instagram regardless of who it is no one responds. No one wants to talk to me or spend any time with me so idky why im even still trying and im so strongly considering paying a male hooker just to sit and spend time with me. I feel like theres no option left since no one will give me the time of day"
41452,bipolar,Meds successfully stopped hypomania.. but I’m not happy about it,"I recently had the lowest 3ish month depression in a really long time. I was so suicidal that I checked myself into the hospital. Got my meds adjusted, got to a point where I was feeling better, and got out. Now I’m feeling okay/good... and it’s that time where I’m “due” for a hypomanic phase again only it’s not happening. Doctors are acting like this is a great thing and that this means meds are working. 

But the thing is.. the thing that makes me be able to survive the lows are knowing that the highs are coming. This “okay” period isn’t enough of a high to counteract multiple months of severe depression. And I usually only get like a week or so in hypomania so if I only get a week of feeling “okay” this will definitely not be enough. I know this is the “normal” I’m supposed to be aiming for but it’s not what I’m used to and it’s underwhelming and disappointing and it’s got me freaked out quite honestly"
41454,bipolar,Has anyone every experienced this?,"I just had a conversation with my psychiatrist about why I've been feeling ""off"" even though I'm stable on this new medication (lithium and latuda). I explained to her this analogy: it's like I'm eating food but there are no spices in anything anymore or all the drinks are watered down or flat. I'm thankful I'm eating but things just aren't as vibrant. She told me it's normal to feel ""dull"" while on medication because that is the normal range. Hypo/mania makes things spicy and too bright and I was used to being that way for years before intervening now. Anyone else feel that way?"
41455,bipolar,I really can’t do this anymore,"I have zero motivation to stay alive. Life feels more like some meaningless task than a rewarding experience like everyone says. I feel way too disabled to work but I’m afraid no one will believe me. I barely have any friendships and no longer have any close relationships. I’m too depressed to have hobbies or any sort of social life. Everything was fine before covid but now my life has become my absolute worst nightmare. This illness is trash. I barely make enough to afford the doctor, my meds and therapy. I’m just slaying away for what? I’m living to work not working to live. All anyone can talk about it how corrupt the system is and what is wrong with the world. It’s obvious that everyone fucking hates it here so why can’t anyone accept my plea to end my life."

My psychiatrist is going to add in Lithium Carbonate in a few weeks but he is having me titrate up on Lexepro since I used to be on it with somewhat positive effects. Although it seems to exhasurbate my stomach effects and right now I am very anxious while I am increasing the dose of this because the stomach effects get alot worse. Has anyone added Lithium to an SSRI and had positive effects??

 I'm really hoping lithium calms down my system because I am mostly trapped inside my head ruminating constantly about negative scenarios in my head and if things don't start to look up soon I dont know what Im going to do.

Currently on 15mg Lexepro and taking 1mg Ativan most days. Im about 13 days on 15mg.

41465,bipolar,My life is more organized during a depressive episode?

Generally I'm able to follow a schedule much easier and don't see my moods as being all over the place.

My only diagnoses at the moment is MDD, but I'm actually afraid of my mood improving because I don't want to go back into an unstable or ""hyperactive"" mood.

Do any of you feel the same way? Could also be ADHD, but it doesn't seem that way because the hyperactivity goes away with the depression.

I have to ask my therapist about this tomorrow.

 Ironically being in depression is the most stable my mood has been in a long time. Depression is still awful though."
41466,bipolar,Who’s walking through the fog?,"24, diagnosed last year with bipolar after cycling for years. Got bad mania, drank alcohol to quiet it, then crippling depression with SI. Hospital for months, still weekly psychiatrist appts. Still so flat mixed with so anxious. Bad insomnia, no appetite, Don’t deserve anything, intrusive thoughts, SI etc.

In hospital started Zoloft 150mg - still on, lithium 900mg - still on, levels ok, with Seroquel IR 50mg, now taking 1000mg at night. After, started 20mg Temaze at night - still on, Lamictal added a few months back now 400mg - still on, just added Trileptal 300mg, will see how it mixes with the five others.

Still barely leave the house, made worse by quarantine. Haven’t drank in a year. Keep filling myself with caffeine and trying so hard not to fuck up my full time job. Partner going through serious work and health problems, I’m trying to be supportive. Friends non-existent and family disintegrating. So alone.

Maybe I’m just acting like “me”? Maybe I miss the highs? Maybe I’m a mess of chemicals? Maybe I don’t know who I am? Maybe they’d be better off without me? Maybe there’s kindness beyond the veil? Maybe I
don’t have to face the painful path ahead?

41467,bipolar,Medication nightmare!!,"So, I’m just now figuring out how much of a nightmare it is to find the right medications. I went into this like okay I’ll take this one medication that my doctor prescribed and everything will be perfect...boy was I wrong! (I’m on my third medication trial) Currently, my psychiatrist literally thinks I’m crazy and a hypochondriac which makes me feel even more horrible and unsure of myself. 

As much as I wanted it to work...I’ve been taking lamictal and so far its been weight neutral which is a huge plus..BUT it’s causing hair loss (i have a bald spot!) and bad cystic acne.  I look in mirror and cry every 15 min. I’m only at 50 mg right now (i was at 100 and she changed it without putting me on anything else which also doesn’t make any sense? Because i feel even more unstable)  I thought I knew what depression was...but after this..it turns out I had no clue. I’ve never felt so mentally unstable before 😞 and honestly I probably wasn’t on a high enough dosage in the first place but if I’m getting bad side effects on such a small dose I can’t imagine what my body will go through if she were to up the dose. 

Can anyone out there relate with taking lamictal? I know these aren’t the normal typical side effects...but they truly are happening to me... I’m at a complete lost here guys. I know it’s not the end of the world but right now in this moment it feels that way."

I realized I was going into a panic attack for the first time in a long time without any build up. So I counted everything blue and my SO got me some ice water then squeezed my hand. Hours later, I’m exhausted and my thoughts are racing. Unfortunately it will probably last a while as I am a SPED teacher going back in to work full time tomorrow so I except a few more attacks and irrational thoughts this week. I’m grateful for this space and my family."
41469,bipolar,The musings of a depressed mind,"I'm feeling sad today. It started this morning while I was making breakfast. I usually clean the kitchen at night, put all the dishes away, clean the counter and sweep the floor. The kitchen is my sanctuary and I like to have it prepared for any morning escapades I choose to embark on: strawberry pie, thumbprint cookies, lemon cake...that's of course when I'm in a more favorable mood, when my brain doesn't feel like its slowly caving in on itself like pudding with a hollow center. 

Today my entire body feels like jello. I felt that pang in my chest when I woke up this morning. My legs and arms felt a little heavy, but the feeling didn't fully reveal itself until I stepped into the kitchen. The moment I opened that squeaky door, I had a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. The aching that makes me feel like an alien trapped in this stupid human body. I just stood there like an idiot for five minutes straight wondering what I was going to do. What was I doing in the kitchen? Why am I here? What am I doing with my life? What's the point of cooking? Or eating? My brain twisted and turned between questions, skidding into the dark halls of its innermost corners.

Yeah I could feel it, today was gonna suck. I could feel stupid little puddles form in the corners of my eyes. Wait for it, what starts as a leak turns into a river by mid afternoon. I look at the spatulas in the corner angrily. I wish I could beat this depression to death, smash it to a thousand pieces against the floor. Hit it over and over again until it went away. Show yourself! I wanna scream. Show yourself so I can hit you in the face and be done with it. 

Every object in the kitchen looks menacing now. The little pink spice containers are way too pink. What the hell are they so happy about anyway? The pans arranged across the wall look way too comfortable together. The utensil holder with all of its glittering sharp metal objects reflecting in the morning light, basking the sun, look like they're having a party and forgot to invite me. I feel angry and frustrated. I slam the kitchen door shut and slowly drag myself back to my room.

I curl up into a ball under the covers and decide to sit there and cry for a little. But right before I'm about to start I remember..dude, I forgot to take my meds today... 🤧😱😭😢😢, do I really have to get up again?"
41470,bipolar,I suddenly sink,"I was on the couch with my boyfriend and best friend, we were sharing photos and laughing, just chatting. Then suddenly it's like a pin drops in slow motion, everything slows down, and I sink. Nothing is good, everything negative surfaces, every reason to hate myself. I fight to put on a brave face, but my body is drained of all concern and motivation. Its instant. Panic comes shortly after as I try to fight it. 

I'm at a party, talking in a group chatting laughing, enjoying myself, then suddenly as I gaze around the group, the slow motion happens, everything is muted, distorted and dimmed, i sink again. Everything comes crashing down. I'm collapsing inside.I have to excuse myself, i cry, i clean up, i chew up a few of my valium. I go back out push through, I've become a great actor. 

Please tell me you guys get this too. Where you sink."
41471,bipolar,"17 prescriptions, no results","I’m feeling really frustrated and hopeless, like there is no help for me. Since my string of hospitalizations four years ago, I have seen countless doctors and tried 17 medications but not been able to find anything that helps. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar (though some doctors aren’t sure this is correct, no one has been able to diagnose me differently), generalized anxiety, PTSD, and OCD (which is mild these days). I’m currently in therapy and go once a week, so I feel like I’m doing everything I can. I haven’t been able to afford a psychiatrist so I get meds from my general physician, but I feel like she just pulls the name of a random med I haven’t tried and passes it off to me. Have any of you had experiences like this? What solutions did you come to or what helped you get through it? I just feel really alone in this, I would love to hear from you all."

She was in the hospital because she had to much lithium in her blood stream and needed dialysis to clean the blood. She had a uti that made her  nuts. Now she is back to being her bitchy self. Btw she also fell. She is refusing help at home like CNA. She is very mean. I sent her to the hospital and she was great full. But now I don’t know what happened.

41474,bipolar,Opinions on what constitutes a mania?,"I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but my therapist recently brought up the possibility that I may be bipolar after I told her I have had a few manic-like episodes.  A couple of times, I started writing a novel, and got pretty hyped up and energetic.  I wrote each novel within 10-14 days, complete.  My need for sleep decreased from 8ish hours per day to 5ish hours per day, and I was never tired, but always full of energy and ideas.  After each novel was complete, I was really exhausted for a few weeks.  I had responsibilities of childcare and work, and I dragged myself through my days, but I had no oomph whatsoever.

When I started to write a third novel, I got that excitable feeling, but tried very hard to quash it.  I did not stay up a few extra hours at night writing, or keep churning the ideas for my characters.  I evened out, and did not have an exhausted period afterward.  Since then, I have had a few times of extra energy, and most I quash and try to even out.  The one time I didn't was when I was moving, and it was helpful to have piles of energy for 18 hours a day for 10 days straight.  And yeah, I was tired as heck after that.

Again, I'm not asking for diagnosis, but does this sound like a mania?  I have a couple of friends who are manic, and their manias are more like, driving to Vegas and charging up credit cards to gamble, or changing up sexual orientation and starring in a porno.  My experiences are rather boring and reserved in comparison.  Feedback welcome, thanks.  And I'm sorry if I offended anyone--I'm in a place of total ignorance here and seeking more info."

43221,bipolar,Suicidal ideation on Lamictal?,"Hi guys. 
I have been taking abilify and lexapro for about a year and a half. I recently added lamictal about a month ago to this without stopping my other meds. I just increased this week to the 50mg dose. 

I’ve been making a lot of progress over the past year but I just feel like ever since I started the lamictal my mood and progress has just tanked. I’ve been much more depressed and overly sensitive lately, for about two weeks now. Last night I had very serious thoughts of suicide. I have not felt actively suicidal since May 2019. But last night I made plans. I feel better after sleeping and calming down but last night was bad. 

I’m talking to my psych tomorrow and I’m going to ask to stop the lamictal. But I was wondering if anyone has had this type of side effect before? I know it could happen if I had stopped the abilify but I have actually kept taking that one so it seems like it could be a side effect from the lamictal. I just want to see if this is legit and if anyone else has experienced this. Thanks."
43222,bipolar,"I don't feel like me anymore, I feel like a liar","Most of the time, I am organized, productive, and I finish things on time even if I don't know how to at first. I was good at improvising and problem solving. My meds changed over summer because a stimulant in my med cocktail + nothing to really work on was driving me crazy with anxiety and stress. So I became the complete opposite. I woke up past 11 am, forgot to take my meds, and struggled to do anything until 5pm. I would try to make coffee, something that is very automatic for me, and get confused and stare at nothing for lengthy amounts of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a job, and talked allllll about how organized and productive I am in the interview. School started late last week. I didn't plan enough for it, but I thought I did, and the kiddos thrive on structure. So there was chaos. Next day was better, but my plans were interrupted because I couldn't use the printer. But there was an incident in my classroom where nobody got hurt, but it was scary. I have a slow reaction/processing time. All I could do was stand there until another adult came to help while I took one of my kiddos outside to help him process what happened. (and he's fine! he calmed down in less than a minute, thank u CBT). The kids are catching onto my distractibility and it's making it worse. I feel like I've let everyone down and lied to my admins. I can't tell them what's going on because this is not a workplace where you can do that. I want to go back to IOP and re-do last week once I'm back. I don't think I've showered since wednesday. 

&amp;#x200B;

The times where I'm distracted and zoning out at school match up with how I was before school started. I'm just talking more, is all. I don't think anything changed except for the setting. I feel empty and incapable of doing the things that I was able to do a few months ago. It's like my brain is full of thoughts but it gets to be too much and it takes a vacation. My psych and I are not on the same page and my meds are not the way they were before summer, despite me having much more on my plate than I've ever had."
43223,bipolar,I need more options,"I am bipolar II apparently. The meds work so how could I not be and SSRIs never works so yeah. I was on lamotrigine for awhile, maybe a year and it was great. No side effects at all except for brain fog. It slowed my brain down for sure. Then in the beginning of July, I started getting absolutely HORRIBLE dry mouth. This coincided with me being pushed to 300 mg on Lamictal from 250. I was fine on 250 but doc just decided to push it up for some reason. 🙄 I also lost 12 lbs from being on Keto for 3 months which took me from 133 to 121. I’m now on 200 but it’s still bad and I’m losing hair too. But the dry mouth was so bad in the beginning that it kept me up all night and not getting the sleep I need is another huge anxiety trigger. Now I use biotene toothpaste and mouthwash and it helps mildly. I have to chew gum literally all day to keep it at bay which is horrible for my teeth. And not having enough saliva is horrible for your teeth and you can develop periodontal disease. Side effects are a huge trigger for me. A big reason I was okay on Lamictal was because I didn’t have the side effects and now here they are in all their annoying glory. To me it doesn’t feel worth it. I feel like 200 isn’t enough for me because I’m starting to emotionally eat again. Not to mention we need to sell our house after a year of owning it and we are painting our entire house because of it. Not to mention I have two young children, 4 and 1. I’m stressed to the max and this medication just seems to be making everything worse. My new psychiatrist who only has 3 years of experience 🙄 said she didn’t want to put me on another medication just because I was experiencing a side effect. This is why I didn’t want to take medication in the first place. SO. I need to know if anyone is on a cocktail of natural-ish supplements that helps them to remain relatively stable? I don’t need any supplement hate. Just something helpful please. 

Tl:dr I need supplement recommendations because I’m about done with medication."

43225,bipolar,Do people (family/friends) downplay your emotions and tell you to change your meds?,"Hey everyone..

Hope all is well for y’all.


Long story short yesterday I had a terrible panic attack that lasted all day. I was supposed to go hang out with my friend in a city nearby, but due to having a toddler and my inability to be on time I was almost three hours late. 

I did let my friend know ahead of time and shared my location, she was not upset at all.

But on the way there I literally almost pooped myself and barely made it to the bathroom. I had to call my mom crying so I could make it there okay.

Moms response is, “Maybe you need to get on an antidepressant”.

I’m on a mood stabilizer, anxiety, and insomnia medication. Every time I try antidepressants they make me feel totally numb, with no sex drive.

My sister this morning pretty much said the same thing. Maybe you need different meds this isn’t an isolated incident.


Like no shit! I have bipolar disorder, and yes I know I need therapy. But obviously I’m sad and having problems and would like to talk it out but instead you just say change your meds.


Just btw the friend I went to go see was around other people and I could tell my vibes were totally off. They actually also had plans to use drugs later in the evening (molly and shrooms). So I ended up leaving after an hour and told her I didn’t feel well. I drove home 1 1/2 away took a bath and went to bed.


It is just so frustrating to have someone tell you to change your meds because of a distressing day or event. My job is beyond stressful too. It hasn’t been a good month I’ve been really up and down.

I guess it wouldn’t hurt to call my psychiatrist and make an appointment to see a therapist. But it just hurts my feelings that every situation is downplayed to here sprinkle some medications on that shit.

I used to smoke thc but had to stop bc of my job. I did start last month and it was a wonderful month, I had to quit about three weeks ago and this is kind of where it started.


Any kind words would just be nice right now :(.

TLDR; Bipolar disorder sucks, needing and relying meds sucks. Having no one to talk to sucks. Distressing situations being downplayed that your meds aren’t working."

I can’t stop shaking, as while I tend to shake because of the fact I was abused, I have never been so shaky than on this medication. I’m randomly nauseous from them and they are just so fucking awful. But if I don’t take them, my psych told me that he will put me in hospital.

This is a relatively dumb post but I'm having this conversation currently and I wanna see what you all have to say!

I grew up with a gambler father who'd always get us on the brink of eviction/lights cut/etc so I've never been particularly crazy with money. If I buy something for myself it's out of necessity and I save money off to the side for big purchases (after bills and actual savings). This kind of explains my relationship with shopping. 

I have bipolar 1 and have had rly intense manic episodes and deal with hypomania kind of on the regular but I've never once been compelled to buy everything I see. Is the money spending thing like... THAT common? I'm more curious than anything!"
43230,bipolar,During my manic episodes I exposed a lot of people,"To HIV. I have to recognize that after I was diagnosed back in late 2014 (due to manic episodes in 2010 and 2011) I refused to have sex. In 2015 and 2016 I only had sex with condoms. But when I started Arvs in early 2017 and read the articles about being undetectable and not being infectious everything went out of control....

From being EXTREMELY depressed all 2015 and part of 2016 I went so euforic during 2017-2018 I had unprotected sex with all sorts of people while being undetectable. I got some STDs, I was wild. I barely sleep during night. My mood went from being extremely happy to irritable. I spent all my money. It was wild. Grandiose delusions that I could achieve everything, that I was powerful, extremely handsome, a sex icon. My delusions were fueled by more men fcking me. I lost my mind. My alcohol consumption was out of control. 

This is mania. It destroyed my life. But I miss it. I miss feeling alive. I was someone back then, now I'm nothing. I feel regret. 😭"

Since taking abilify my mood swings have been more angry and more leaned towards suicidal thoughts. Is it just me or do these meds make things worse in the beginning ?

43233,bipolar,Physical Agitation,"Does anyone else feel a tingling sensation in various parts of their body? It’s not a good feeling - like an imperfection combined with a muscle knot. The worst of it is often in my stomach and if it gets too bad I basically just have to give in, in a way, like accept that I’m in the “hell state” and ride it out knowing if it acts the way it has always acted it will go away and return, etc. It goes up and down and intensity, but remains at a low level almost always. It’s probably the main thing that prevents me from seeking comfort in relationships. I don’t feel like I can give if I’m constantly self-regulating to protect myself and others.

I practice mindfulness, I’ve cut down coffee intake to 1 - 2 cups a day, cut out alcohol almost entirely but still taking kratom in a moderate dose daily, I quit smoking completely, I do cardio, weights, and yoga - I look healthy and can control myself. But the body load can get intense and I have a hard time keeping it all in. I’m scared of freaking people out by letting the intensity, which can ultimately look like anger, slip. I can find temporary relief through exercise - for maybe 4 - 24 hours, but it always comes back. I know if I didn’t exercise it would be horrible. It feels like that movie Crank with Jason Statham, where I have to re-up with some form of mind-altering activity or I will descend into the “hell-state” and stay there.

Not on meds at the moment, or seeing professionals, but I’ve done both before and I want to get organized and go back.

43235,bipolar,Severe Months Long Depressive Episode + Getting Dumped = Complete Mental Breakdown,"This is gonna be a long one... so bare with me and thank you for reading if you finish it.

I’m 25/F. I was living in S.Korea for about a year. I’ve been battling some pretty bad suicidal thoughts since late March. At the same time, I started dating this guy. It was the first healthy relationship I’ve ever had with someone and he supported me fully. I was so happy with him. The happiest I’ve ever been in my life actually (despite my mental health). He knew from the get go that I was bipolar and struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. I remember once in early April while we were on the phone, I told him I felt like I didn’t have a reason to live and he said “well what about me?” I told him that’s a lot of responsibility but he said he could handle it. We had a lot of fun, he called me every day, constantly reassured me and told me he cared, and always told me it was okay whenever I lashed out at him because of my anxiety. I leaned on him pretty heavily and, essentially, he was the thread barely holding me together.

Anyway, fast forward to mid-July. He had just gotten fired from his job (which was basically his entire life and identity) and we were planning a trip since he now had free time and I was going on vacation soon. We spent the following weekend together and everything seemed fine, aside from my occasional anxiety and depressive moods. He often felt like he was hurting me or it was his fault, but I always told him that it wasn’t— it’s my illness. Then, a couple days later, exactly once week after he got fired, he came over and broke up with me. He said he felt like I was forcing him to be my boyfriend and that he had lost his feelings for me. Ouch. But he said he wanted to still be friends because he really cares about me and was extremely worried I would hurt myself. In the end, he agreed to give me a chance to ease up on the whole “boyfriend” pressure I was putting on him.

We still talked the next day and everything seemed normal. Then the NEXT day, I sent him some pretty dark thoughts I was having, which was not something I hadn’t done before. It wasn’t new. I said stuff like “do you want my iPad after I die? My ps4? Maybe I’ll just throw everything away.” He read my texts but ignored them. I checked up on him a few times while I was at work asking if he was okay or if I did something wrong, but he ignored all my texts. So when I got off work, I called him. Blocked it. Called him again. Went to voicemail. Then he texted me, “I can’t take this anymore. Please leave me alone.” I asked him what he was talking about. He said, “suicide threat? Seriously? Please.” Then ghosted me. Eventually blocked my number, blocked me on Instagram, etc.

I was shaken. He talked to me about relationship pressures but never once told me my mental health issues were weighing so heavily on him. I felt completely blindsided. It sent me spiraling. A mutual friend texted him for me to ask what happened and he just told her that he couldn’t handle me anymore, he was going through a major life change, and he was tired of the relationship. Suddenly, all of my thoughts completely turned irrational and went in endless circles trying to understand what happened. Figure out what went wrong and how I could fix it. I basically lost the only thing in my life giving me the will to live.

Then I started to believe that everyone was lying to me and that he was lying to me our entire relationship. That he never cared. I told myself that if he DID care, everything was my fault and I pushed him away. Then I was convinced that everyone in my life would leave me too because of my bipolar. This wasn’t the first time I ruined a relationship/friendship due to my depression and anxiety. So even now, I fully believe that I will eventually push everyone away because I’m too much to handle. That everyone says it’s fine, but one day, it suddenly won’t be. “I can’t take this anymore. Please leave me alone” has been engraved in my mind and it’s all I see when I close my eyes.

I decided I wanted to leave Korea (running away from my problems is my forte). But literally a week after I was ghosted, my cat got sick and I was told she would die unless she got this treatment that would cost me thousands of dollars. I did it because she’s my baby; it’s still ongoing. I’m nearly in debt now because of it. But now, I would have to stay in Korea for 6 months until her treatment was over. I was trapped.

Everything piled up. My dying cat plus the break up... I broke. Two weeks later, I tried to kill myself. I overdosed. My friends managed to figure out what I had done (I texted them some questionable things while high af on the drugs— I don’t even remember it) and they called an ambulance. Five days later, I was put on a plane and forced to come home. My friend texted my ex and told him what happened and said I’d like to see him or talk before I left. He said he would text me but he didn’t think meeting was a good idea. And he thanked her for caring for me. It’s been a week since I left and I’ve still not heard from him. It sucks.

I’m still in a fragile state. I had to leave my cat behind in korea with a good friend. My friend recently got very angry with me because I was unhappy she called an ambulance and saved me. She’s still caring for my cat, but she doesn’t talk to me anymore.

I’m on medication and I’m not having constant panic attacks anymore... but the longing to die is still very strong. I feel like I was forced to come home and that I’ve lost control over everything in my life. I don’t even have control over whether I live or die right now. I’m just going through the motions while constantly thinking of ways to kill myself. But I’m being closely monitored by my parents and they’ve hidden all my meds. I feel so guilty that I’ve stressed everyone out. I feel guilty that so many people are trying to help me but I still desperately want to die. And these are just things rationalizing my desire to die even more. This was my second suicide attempt and I failed again. I don’t see myself growing old or even making it to 30. I don’t want to. Not if I have to live with this for the rest of my life. I currently don’t have any plans to act on these thoughts, but they are extremely overwhelming."

43238,bipolar,Terrified but somehow relieved.,"Okay so this is my first post to Reddit, I wasn't sure if I should put a self-harm trigger or sexual abuse trigger. So yeah... Both.

...


I (21f) am in the process of being diagnosed with bipolar. I have had a friend tell me that, that was probably what was going on with me even before a psychiatrist said it (this friend has the same issue and has spent some time in an institution) 

I am so scared because I don't want to feel like I am out of control and there is nothing I can do about it. I am so afraid to go to people because although depression is widely understood, I can't even seem to understand the hypomania nor do I know when it is happening. 

I believe the onset was about 3 years ago when I was 18 after I was raped, blamed, had a miscarriage and subsequently lost all of my friends. I had such a terrible episode where I believed that everyone was watching me, I thought that people were part of a secret society ""those that see"" and I wasn't part of it but was somehow going through an initiation. There was a period of time when I heard voices that weren't there but I was so convinced it wasn't in my head and another time when I thought the left side of my body was being controlled by some external force. 

I also have episodes where I can spend hours having a conversation with someone who is not there. And I know that there's no one there but I can still hear replies in my head and even thought I know it is in my head I will still talk out loud to it. 

Sometimes when I feel like I have too much energy and I don't know what to do with it (especially if I haven't slept in a few days) I feel justified in picking up a blade and cutting my thighs or hips, this is usually followed by an insane crash into depression where I don't move or just cry uncontrollably for a few days or weeks. 

I don't know if I want to take medication because I am a creative person and I'm about to start a creative course in uni and I am scared that the meds will take that away from me. I'm scared it would take away my empathy and honestly, I am terrified to gain weight. (I know that sounds superficial but I love my body, it took me a while to get to the point that I am, I spent almost two years of my life crying at the sight of food or binge eating and making myself puke after. My body has always been ""ideal"" from other people's perspective but I am only now learning to love it and I don't want to lose that) is it a bad idea to refuse meds? Should I at least try? I'm so scared. 

I feel like I'm in limbo and I simply don't know how to get out of it. I've been drinking far more than I usually do just to feel like a normal human being but I'm finding it so difficult to come to terms with this. I don't want this to be my life. I keep blaming myself and hurting myself. I'm so scared that I'll lose my friends again (different ones from before) and I know my family won't believe me if I tell them. 

I can breathe a little sigh of relief though. I now understand that there may actually be something wrong with my brain and it makes me feel a little less guilty for my changing emotions and state of mind. 

How does one live with the knowledge that my mind may be fighting me for the rest of my life? (I'm not suicidal just genuinely wondering how people live with this)"

I undergo med changes and see a counselor (though in between currently), but I haven’t been able to shake this feeling.  Aside from the occasional lifting I experience with weed, I feel weighed down.  I envy the lives of those around me and despite my best efforts can’t muster the energy/courage to overcome my anxieties/feelings and grab hold of my (one and only) life.

Just recently found this sub and already I relate to so much.  I’ve had an extremely rough few months and within days it’s like a flip switched. I’m more “myself” then I have been in months and without even realizing I’ve been sleeping extremely late without being the slights bit of tired I even wake up extremely early and do crafts or simply make and design random things. I’m also more outgoing and talkative. Usually I push my friends away and never text anyone now I’m constantly texting everyone. I’ve even met a new friend whom I’ve grown extremely close to and text from the moment we wake up till the moment we go to sleep. She’s honestly the only part of my day that I look forward to. And I’m sure it’s just a manic relationship especially because I have been hyper sexual. I want to form relationships with people who I know I’ll only ghost and push away once my episode ends. 


Also I am going through a pretty tough breakup. But of course I’ve started to disassociate from the fact that it’s ended. I know that will also bite me in the ass once this is over.  I keep telling myself that I am “normal” and that these are all normal things a person does. But as the days continue to pass I notice more and more that I am indeed having an episode.. 

I want to continue to live off this high and I’m scared for when it’s going to end. Considering this is the best I’ve felt in a really long time. I keep trying to convince myself that my actions are “normal” simply because I don’t want this to end and me to fall back into the depressive state after being in one for months. 

Unfortunately I am coming to terms that I am hypomanic and it upsets me quite a bit to realize I can’t keep lying to myself."
43243,bipolar,My SO and I both have bp but this is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever had and I’m so happy :),"Idk I just wanted to share since I spend so much time on this sub and love the support we have for everyone here.

I thought there was no hope for me to have a good relationship, having a mood disorder and especially after a failed marriage. But my SO and I have been together for over a year now and it’s going really well. I’ve never felt more loved, understood, accepted, cared for and supported. I’ve never smiled so much and laughed so hard or been held tighter when I cry. I’ve never opened up so much and felt comfortable being 100% myself before. I didn’t think love like his existed or that I even deserved something like this. I can’t imagine a future without him. After so many horrible mistakes and struggles in my life, I feel incredibly lucky to have found him.

That’s it. I hope y’all have a good weekend 💙"
43244,bipolar,"Medication/Drug issues (x post from r/bipolar2, not asking for med recs)","Hi everyone, newbie here (to the forum, not the diagnosis). 


I’ve tried every medication under the sun, most of them have either a) not worked, b) not worked and given me horrible side effects or c) worked and given me side effects. One medication (rexulti) even sent me to the hospital. I glare in annoyance when I see commercials for it (ಠ_ಠ) All of these side effects also restrict the drug classes available to me, even though I’ve done the Genomind assay for interactions. 



I’ve basically been on constant doses of lamictal (f those chalky pills) and depakote (praise those glossy pills) for a very long time, with extras thrown in depending on my symptoms. Right now I’m just...blah. 


That was just some background. I’m kind of to the state where I’ll look at all of the pills I have to take (I have other Rx meds as well) and I get so depressed just looking at them that I don’t end up taking them, which I know is the worst thing to do. 


I’m also to the point where I am craving to feel a high (stimulant - my doc wont refill my adderall, even though she’s asked if I need a refill for over a year and I’ve said no), or even a downer (I have some sleeping pills and she did actually refill my klonopin). I’ve been drinking a lot more than normal and have been taking the remainder of the narcotics I got for surgery...1 year ago. 


The combo of things is sometimes dangerous, and then I’ll even add on my regular medications (if I haven’t already taken them that day) because I know it’ll increase the high. 


Folks...I don’t know what to do. I have a therapist that I could call, but I probably wouldn’t tell her, and I definitely wouldn’t tell my psychiatrist. To be clear, I am not suicidal. Just being high (legally - I have a big kid job that drug tests) takes away the intense stress of my life right now, but I know it’s not a solution. 


To be honest, I’ve even been casually researching other types of drugs (which I suppose would show up on a drug test), but I’d have no idea how to even get them. 


Basically, I need help, but also don’t want help because the high/low from meds/alcohol are nice. Surely someone can relate? 


Thank you to anyone who read this far.  


p.s. - I’m sorry this was kind of rambly and got off topic. I’m just feeling kind of lost right now."

45019,bipolar,"I know a lot of people struggle with self-love, myself included. I’d like to share the dream I had tonight..","I hope it’s ok to post this here.

I woke up from another nightmare related to my past. I don’t remember a lot of details. I remember I was really young again in that dream. It was my birthday in it, and I had ended up being selected for something really special.

I was a little kid again, but my interests in that dream reflected my adult interests. It was supposed to be a really nice birthday, the best one ever. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) was there, and other famous actors and actresses. They were there for me, because it was a special day for me. 

I don’t remember why I was selected for that kind of elaborate celebration. I don’t think that was what was important about the dream anyway, I think what was important was how I felt about it all...

I was probably around 8 years old in that dream. Despite these great people all getting together for me, I felt.. undeserving the whole time of the attention I was receiving. Like I... hadn’t done anything to earn it. 

At one point, when The Rock was leading me somewhere to meet these other famous people, along the way, I asked him if he preferred to be called “The Rock” or “Rock” and he smiled and said “The Rock” and he called me his friend. And that felt really nice. To have someone famous and important like that call me a friend. Cause in the dream, up until that point, I never really felt I had any.

And that made me want to start crying inside the dream, that someone had called me their friend. (Now I’m crying in real life, realizing how broken I really am). I didn’t cry right away in the dream. I held back the tears. But I felt like I didn’t deserve that kind of affection... 

The Rock saw me crying, and he looked really concerned. I just wanted to thank him for taking the time out of his day to spend it with me, but then the tears started pouring out. The nice thing was... how accepting he was. He didn’t care that I began to cry, he didn’t get mad at me the way people often would when I was growing up. He just smiled in an understanding way and it made me feel better. I felt.. safe around him and that maybe I somehow did deserve a day for myself.

I’m glad I had this dream. Waking up from it, it’s made me realize that all my life, I’ve never felt worthy of love. How awful is that? Not just as an adult but, for a kid to have to feel like he needs to do something in order to ‘attain’ love? Shouldn’t being a kid be enough to warrant love on its own from your parents, without having to fulfill some sort of ‘requirement?’ 

I experienced daily emotional abuse and neglect from my stepfather. On a few occasions, physical. Though the few times he got physical with me, I felt like he wanted to kill me so I did whatever I could to obey his rules every time after. I was too scared to even look him in the eyes growing up for fear of being yelled at or hit. I went outside and cried nearly every day, asking God why no one loved me.

The most sickening part for outsiders looking in on my life, is that they think my mother loved me. But she didn’t. She has deep emotional attachment issues, and that’s not love. I know that my bond to her has always been superficial; I’ve never once felt understood or seen by her, despite what to an outsider might seem like an outpouring of affection. Plus, she let me suffer abuse for countless years, and she in turn emotionally abused my stepsister.

I’m surprised I can still recognize what true love is and feels like. Though I’ve never fully experienced it from anyone, I’ve always maintained hope that it’s real. Not the kind of manipulative, controlling type that my family is used to. But a different, healthy type. 

A type that allows you to be the best version of yourself because you feel appreciated and cared for who you are. A type where you feel seen and heard, and valued for your opinions even if they’re not agreed with. A type of love that allows you to feel free, instead of restricted. Maybe that’s why I’ve dreamt of flying so often, too.

(I wrote this out right after I woke up in hopes that I’ll be able to read it to a therapist someday soon. Seeing as how I don’t currently have one, I thought I’d like to share it with someone, anyone, even if they’re a stranger.. I think it’s just good to get things out sometimes. And maybe you can relate if you’re reading this [I kind of hope you don’t, honestly. I don’t want anyone to have felt/feel the way I did/do]. Anyway, thank you for letting me share)."

45024,bipolar,Lack of Empathy for other mental illnesses,"Please don't hate me for this post!  Basically, it comes down to this - whenever people talk about their anxiety issues or their mild depression or whatever else where they take like one pill for and it WORKS with NO side effects - I completely lack empathy.  In my defense, what other people consider ""Depressed"" or ""Anxious"" is my stability, my good days, and the only way I get those is by taking drugs that give me miserable side effects.  


BUT I don't want to be that person.  At work they are on this big ""mental wellness"" craze because of how COVID 19 effected so many people and their mental health.  I don't want to be sitting there thinking, ""Just get over it, at least you don't lose your mind so badly that there has been a warrant out for you"".  I want to have empathy, I want to help and support and raise people up.

45027,bipolar,Live. Die. Repeat.,"That's what it feels like. I'm 35. I was diagnosed bipolar 5 years ago, but I have been struggling for longer than that. I've been on so many meds that I need both hands and feet to count them all. I've been desperate for relief from being depressed and anxious for 20 years. Especially after I began having manic episodes. And then those episodes began to cycle faster between lows and highs and then I didn't feel just manic but I felt mixed and I honest to God feel overwhelmed with madness some nights.

It's agony. 

I elected to undergo electro convulsive therapy about 4 years ago. It was... shocking. Ha. I lost a lot of memories and it permanently blasted a hole in my ability to remember and to recall. But I had to admit that my extremes weren't AS extreme. Still... I continued to suffer. I was fortunate enough to qualify for disability which led to decent health insurance and access to regular therapy. Eventually Vraylar and Latuda hit the market and I've had some response to both.

I had a marriage. It crashed and burned in no small part because of my loosening grip on reality. It took a long time to find a combination of meds, therapy, coping methods, and a support group that enabled me to feel like I could have a life again. And I tried. And for a while I did have a life again. I had my own place, a partner, a part time job, and some kind of happiness. Until it got hard again. My part time job's extra income disqualified me from a portion of my coverage, specifically the part that covers those name brand bipolar meds for which there aren't yet any generics.

I lost everything. Again. I crashed and burned all over again. So here I am, standing at the edge of the abyss. I've been here before. It used to scare me to look into all that darkness. But I've been to the bottom of that pit. I've been inside the hospital crying and yelling for some kind of reprieve from all of the goddamn PAIN in my soul.

And the worst part is that this is my life. I live a little. I lose control and succumb to rapid mood swings and mixed episodes. I've also been diagnosed BPD so my ability to control my thoughts during intense bouts of emotion is difficult. I hurt and I lose my shit and I go a little crazy. Crying, seeing and hearing things, laughing and yelling and feeling like my goddamn mind is being ripped apart while feeling an impulsive need for SELF DESTRUCTION. And then I go back in the hospital and I die inside until all that's left is numbness.

And then it'll slowly get better. Only... I've caught on to what's going on. Right now my mind feels on the edge of fucking madness. I'm putting all my effort into measuring my words carefully. But it feels like my life, because there is no cure for what I have, is destined to follow this pattern. Descend into darkness. Emerge. Live cautiously. Hope. Live with a purpose. TOTAL FUCKING MAYHEM. Try desperately to put the pieces back together. Rage and spit and scream. Spend a week in the hospital. Climb the hill again. Fall. Get injured. Recover. Climb. Fall...

I don't want to die. I'm not asking for help and this isn't a goodbye. But... fuck. I am so tired of this battle in my head for stability and sanity. I am so so damn tired of the fight. I just want to feel close to something warm and there's nothing inside to cling to anymore. I want to live but I don't know why I'm doing it anymore. There's no great battle for me. There's no cause. I am lost in my own world and selfishly losing my shit while the world spins on and I don't understand the POINT of it. This pain and the suffering and the fucking mystery of it all and understanding that life is a cycle of sanity and madness and I get it, meds are supposed to help but there have been so many and nothing lasts and it just comes back to this over and OVER again. I try to create happiness and I always end up back in a puddle of shit.

I don't know what the point of writing this is. I guess it's a sort of big middle finger to this life. I've cried while typing this out so maybe it helped me acknowledge my pain. Sometimes I stand outside when the wind starts picking up and I close my eyes and I feel the world wash over me. I feel the air buzzing around my skin. I breathe in deep. There's clean air. I can feel the warmth of the sun on my face. For a moment I feel peace. That's it. So that's what I'll be thinking about when I go back to the hospital. Those brief, personal moments in between large swaths of utter bullshit.

I've run out of things to rant about. I don't know if this has been helpful or horseshit but it's my heart and my mind and it's on the internet now so there aren't any take backs."

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 13, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and quickly put onto fluoxetine (Prozac). I did not in fact have depression- I did not have suicidal thoughts, I never self-harmed, I didn't have significantly low moods for any length of time. I was dissociating because of emotional abuse I was suffering at the hands of a parent and step-parent. I was essentially shut-down emotionally and was not speaking or really doing anything, just staring into space mostly. It's the brain's way of protecting you from further emotional damage. However none of my doctors thought to enquire further as to why I was behaving this way, instead they just shoved me straight onto a strong anti-depressant which made me physically sick, and then made me manic. My mum assumed they knew what they were doing, and my dad was one of my abusers so of course he wasn't going to say anything against it.

When the doctors realised I was becoming swiftly more and more manic (unable to calm down, laughing uncontrollably, huge amount of energy), they took me off the Prozac, then put me straight on to Aripiprazole, which is an anti-psychotic commonly used to treat bipolar disorder (my new diagnosis). This quickly brought me back to what they considered ""normal"", but gave me painful muscle tremors and the inability to concentrate or sleep. I stopped taking the drugs, instead holding them in my cheek and spitting them out later. I became manic again in less than a few weeks, worse this time, and I ran away from home. When I spoke I wasn't coherent and I started having hallucinations and delusions. I was resentful and angry, both at the way I was treated at home and the way I was forced onto medication that messed with my brain, rather than being given therapy/counselling. I was persuaded to come back into the house, and eventually the police were called as the doctors/nurses couldn't get me to come back to hospital without physically restraining me. I had to be handcuffed and carried into the ambulance. 

Eventually the doctors realised the painful side effects weren't going away, in fact they were getting worse, so after a few weeks they also put me on Procyclidine, a medication to help the painful tremors,  and that actually worked pretty well. They told me I'd have to be on the anti-psychotics for the rest of my life, and that the reason I was getting manic delusions was because there was something wrong with my brain chemistry. I felt ashamed by this. 

Fast forward a few years, I'm now 19 and I've left home. I'm still on the meds, and I've accepted that I'm just someone with mental health issues, and kinda put it to the back of my mind. I have very low self-esteem and no concept of my own boundaries. I have learned growing up that if I put others before myself I won't get into trouble, so I let various people take advantage of me. I don't know how to tell anyone ""no, I'm not comfortable with the way you are treating me"". I always feel a little bit numb and I don't really know what I'm feeling on a deeper level. I get into really bad habits and develop several addictions- sugary foods, sex with new partners- that I just can't seem to kick. I know there's something wrong but it's like I don't have the ability to do anything about it. I feel like I'm drifting through life, unable to direct myself or even really enjoy it, I feel disconnected. I drop out of university, I manage a basic college course but after that I struggle to get any kind of job beyond working as a kitchen porter because I have no self-confidence or drive.

At age 25, I decide to try coming off the meds. I don't know what else to do. I've been emotionally abused, sexually assaulted, manipulated, and I still don't know why I let that happen or why I can't connect with myself. I don't know who I am anymore. For the first few weeks, I don't really feel any different. Then, about a month later, I get huge spikes of anxiety at random, for no apparent reason. I get heart palpitations as though I'm having a panic attack, then they disappear. I worry that maybe this is because the meds aren't ""protecting"" me anymore, but I decide to wait and see what happens. A few weeks later, I'm gradually feeling more and more aware and... the only way I can describe it is awake. As though part of me was asleep for all that time I was on the meds. It sounds really stupid and new-agey but it's true. 

I realise with growing horror that I'm now able to ""sense"" people's intentions for me, much more easily than I could before. My junk food and sex addictions literally vanish. I feel sickened that the person I was a few months before wanted and craved those things and let herself be used by others. I am suddenly aware of which people in my life actually care about me as a person, and which people couldn't care less. 

About 2 months later, I'm hanging out with friends and my boyfriend, who I had recently got back together with. (I'd realised he was one of the people who really cared about me). We take some acid which I hadn't tried before (I do NOT recommend this). It's a fun experience with pretty colours until I start dissociating. I feel like I'm somewhere far away in my own head and don't realise where I am. I don't feel like I'm in my own body anymore and start crying. I eventually come back to myself the next day, safely at my boyfriend's place. I think carefully about this and realise the reason I was so upset is because I had dissociated before, when I was 13. I didn't know what it was at the time, being a child. I didn't know how to tell anyone, even if I had felt like talking. 

I just really wish that the people who were supposed to be looking after my wellbeing had thought about what they were doing and waited to see if I would come back to myself given a bit of time and space. I have read some scientific books on the subject (Anatomy of an Epidemic by Robert Whitaker was the most helpful) and I realise they didn't know any better, but still. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Did you find anti-psychotics or other bipolar meds helped you long-term, or did they make you feel worse in different ways? 

Again, I don't wish to scare anyone or put them off taking meds. I do think they could help some people, I just didn't find they helped my situation specifically."
45031,bipolar,Adjusting to college without alcohol,"Coming back to college I’ve come back with a new mentality: I’m not here to get drunk and fucked up anymore, I’m here to find healthy ways to have fun and keep away from alcohol and other things that bring on my hypomania. But whenever I hear people laughing during a drinking session with their friends in my neighboring apartment or see videos of my friends having fun drunk it makes me miss the days where I could be a part of all of that. I know staying sober is what’s best for me mentally and with my med cocktail I could end up in a lot of trouble if I don’t stay sober. But now I dread weekends where I have to watch the people I used to have fun with getting fucked up while wishing I could join from the sidelines. Staying in and talking with people or playing games doesn’t bring nearly the same rush and makes me crave my old life.

45039,bipolar,Latuda Issues,"EDIT: Going off Latuda completely. Beginning lithium at a very low dose to help boost Lamictal. Wish me luck!

First time poster. I'll try to keep this concise, but I have a few questions for everyone.

I started Latuda going on 3 months ago. I noticed a huge positive change in my mood swings and general emotional wellbeing quite quickly. Not long after that, I noticed a huge change in my energy level. I've been on many different psych meds over the years and have never felt this level of fatigue and fogginess before. I truly have that ""zombie"" feeling. I have told my doc about it, but he has encouraged me to stick it out and see if the side effects subside. They have not. I had been thinking that the positive changes are worth the fatigue, but it has gotten to the point where I can barely function. I have a toddler, pets, and a job, so I cannot afford to be exhausted constantly. I also experience frequent migraines, so when I am migraine free I don't want to still feel like crap. Suffice it to say, I no longer think the Latuda is worth it. Also, it is massively expensive. I am also on Lamictal and have been for several years.

Questions for anyone who has been on Latuda with these side effects: 
-If you experienced these kinds of side effects, did they subside? If so, how long did it take?
-Did a different medication make a big positive change but not make you foggy and tired? What was it?
-What was your experience with going off Latuda? I have heard it is awful. I've only been on it a few months, so I don't know how bad it might be."
46835,bipolar,"Feeling guilty for being mentally ill and not having it ""bad enough""","Hi guys, 

I've been struggling mentally my entire life, but have been seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist and taking meds for 11 years. (Female, 25y)  I've tried and done everything, been diagnosed with dozens of mental disorders, but I've been seeing a doctor at a public hospital who is treating me for bipolar type II. 

My problem is that I don't feel legitimate. I feel like I've had so many privileges in my life; my parents are immigrants but I was born and raised in a rich country with free healthcare and education, I've got scholarships/stipends/loans to live off of while studying at university and have a mom who helps me out financially, I've got nice things (nice apartment, phone and computer, nice makeup...)

I know saying that I have nice things seems silly, but it makes me feel ungrateful and spoiled and that my mental health issues are ""made up"", that I've convinced myself that I have it bad when there are people who don't have all the privileges I have. It sounds so silly typing this out, but I feel bad about... feeling bad, I guess. I also feel like my bipolar is so mild compared to everyone else's, my bulimia and drug abuse isn't as bad as many other people's, I don't have the courage to commit suicide. 

I also don't feel legitimate because I'm able to study (haven't dropped out), I got good grades this year... why do I feel this way? It makes me feel so bad, I feel dirty and disgusting for seeing mental health professionals and I feel like they're thinking that I'm a spoiled brat without real problems.

I feel like I need to ""justify"" why I feel so bad, but I know people have been through the same things as I have or even worse without reacting like I do and it makes me feel awful and guilty and I feel like my family and friends are ashamed and disgusted by me... 

Has anyone been through this? How do you deal with these feelings?"
46836,bipolar,Loosing momentum...,"Every person who has left me or ive cut off have all said the same stuff like “go seek help, find support in friends, go to therapy”. The funny thing is tho ive worked and am actively working on myself mentally and trying to be somewhat stable which we all know is a lifetime battle, im so happy with my progress but im just loosing momentum because i cant find who will talk to me long enough to be my friend or hear whats actually wrong, Instead im told pushed aside and told to work on myself or find friends which is so ironic dont get me started.... but yea idk im just loosing momentum im doing everything humanly possible to be a better me and it never seems to be good enough for anyone to be my friend or support system"
46838,bipolar,Bipolar delusions or on the schizophrenic spectrum?,"Hello, hope all is well with you :) 

Have been on Lamotrigine for about 2/3 weeks now, i mean I still have hypomanic episodes and depressive episodes but their not as intense?? not sure if it's just a placebo effect that my mind has convinced myself, but nonetheless, I drank 2 days ago. As much as I tell myself I'm not an alcoholic the more I'm realizing that I'm probably reaching that point. Prior to drinking, I would say I was in a manic state where all I could think about was becoming a PA for the ultra wealthy 1% elite rich. I don't know why but whenever I feel manic my goal is to become a stinky filthy rich billionaire, and it's sort of like I actually believe I can totally reach that goal? LOOOL. I started reading so many articles, websites and even advice on reddit, reading stories of those sharing their personal experiences with that line of work; it's like i was breathing, feeding and urinating out this freaking idea, i couldn't get my mind on anything else. I saw a cicada outside of my window and believed that this freaking insect was trying to tell me something or that ""it's a sign"". I always think something is a ""sign"" Then I drank, woke up later on in the night feeling a little hungover but no too much, couldn't fall back to sleep. Then all of a sudden I suddenly get this panic attack feeling, it felt like my reality was breaking, i had feelings telling me that I'm a horrible person (in my defence ngl i am a shitty person) i was having an epiphany but a nasty one that Im fucking trash and i'm worthless and yada yada yada, i mean i seriously thought I was going to die, just pacing in my room back and forth. Once, the feeling subsided I began to feel ""normal"". Will definately be telling my psychiatrist and see what she thinks. If you are going to drink always double check, get a green light from your GP/psychiatrist and start off slow, thanks!"
46839,bipolar,A week,Thursday I spoke with my nurse practitioner to make a follow up appointment with my psychiatrist and book an appointment with a new shrink as well. During the conversation it’s came to realizing unbeknownst I’ve been taking 500mg pills not 250mg. So I’ve been taking 3000mg a day the past month while it was supposed to be 1000mg so they took the high dosage as concerning so they cut me back to 4 pills a day instead of 6 till I have a video appointment on Monday for my follow up. Later that day I broke up with my boyfriend of 10 months which was something that I’ve been holding onto for a month now. But since the dosage decrease I feel a mess. My mood has elevated and I feel like snapping and loosing it a bit.  I’m not on any antidepressants either until my mood stabilizers are at a good point. I guess I just need to vent.
46840,bipolar,A question. *possible Hypersexual trigger*,"So I was basically wondering how the people who struggle with hyper sexuality deal with that side of the manic/hypomanic episodes? I haven’t had one in a while and I’ve been in a wonderful committed relationship. But I keep thinking, “let’s just download a couple hookup apps and see what happens”. It really keeps me awake and I don’t want to slip into that and ruin my relationship with my gf."
46841,bipolar,"I just need to ramble, feel free to completely ignore this.","I’m banned from Facebook for three days for being inflammatory. I’ve been going multiple days in a row without any human interaction at all (which is basically like death to me as far as I’m concerned, my brain doesn’t slow down, turn off or shut up) and it’s not really so much that I’m lonely, well I am, but it’s more than that. There’s just thoughts in my head all the time, and I feel such an urge to share them and have no outlet. I feel like I’m slowly going insane but not in a scary way, just like I’m losing a grip on things way. I don’t want to hurt anyone or myself, but I can’t comprehend what’s going on in the world right now and everything is so upside down. Rituals, consistency, patterns and routines help keep me in check and those are all gone. Communication is and has always been extremely important to me and not being able to do so on a regular basis is throwing me way off.  I would love so very much to be able to channel all these thoughts and all this energy into something productive or useful, like making art or building something but focus just seems to be eternally out of my grasp. I can’t sit with my own thoughts alone, it’s like there’s a pressure of them building up in my head and I have to communicate them to people before I suffocate. So I have to (and thank god they exist) go to social media platforms to keep the never ending thoughts from popping my head like a balloon. There hasn’t been a single medication that has worked for me for more than 5 months or so without some kind of horrific side effect popping up or it just plain becoming ineffective. I’m not bitching and moaning, I don’t even feel that upset so much as overwhelmed with the sheer insanity that is planet earth right now and comprehending it, or trying to, seemed to set my brain way off in the most overwhelming way. When I was in a relationship I would usually just rattle all of this nonsense off to my partner,  but I’m not in one now. It’s like I just wake up, am bombarded by 1 million and one thoughts all at the same time, and have no one to get them out to. I feel like an ass hat coming here and spewing all this word vomit but I honestly have no idea how to keep myself ok if I’m not expressing the way I feel to someone constantly. I was about to say I exhaust myself, but I don’t. Exhaustion would be welcome. It’s just 110% on 110% of the time and I’ve an aversion to sleep because there’s so much going on in my head how could I possibly even try to sleep, I’m not actively avoiding my sleeping pills so much as it just doesn’t seem appetizing if that makes sense. I’m so ready for rona to be over and to hopefully feel at least somewhat baseline at some point. I could keep typing but this has got to be a great deal to digest if anyone is reading it anyway. So I guess just thanks for allowing me the space to get things out of my head for a little bit and get at least a little bit of respite"

Been having quite the mixed episode for a while and PDoc is doing his best to find the right meds. Anyways so I’m barely holding back tears most of the day. Then comes the incident I should have just ignored and I went from worthless to raging and my brain says “just. say. the thing” 

Sigh. 

I wish facial recognition on phones could recognize when you’re just super agitated and you should not be on social media and lock down those apps. Maybe make you do some zen calming shit before you can open the apps or even lock you out for 24 hours. 

Outcome, fucked up some relationships. Permanently? Not sure yet."
46844,bipolar,I went off my medication! :D,"I've been in a depressed state for almost 4 years now, since I started Lamictal! I had a  hunch that it was the Lamictal locking me in since I never had a manic episode again and I was right. 

It took a few weeks of being off of it but now I'm definitely manic! :D

I'm already back on the Lamictal, don't worry. I'm just hoping it chills me out a little and locks in the mania. I can't be depressed another damn day!"
46847,bipolar,Do you write off all your paranormal/spiritual experiences as mania/psychosis?,"When I was a teenager, I had two faceless tall men in hats who stood by my bed when I slept.  I told a friend and she suggested they were angels protecting me and I believed that for 20 years. 

I've seen demons surrounding a person who is suffering, or ghosts in church basements. Last year a shadow creature walked through my house, I was wide awake in full light in the kitchen and saw him.  God has spoken to me on multiple occasions. 

Prior to my diagnosis, it never occurred to me that these experiences were hallucinations.  But now I'm never quite sure.  I dont 100% believe in the supernatural, but I believe these things when I experience them.

How do you differentiate between manic symptoms and actual spiritual/paranormal experiences?"
46848,bipolar,Joy and hypomania/mania,"Uh oh, everything's going too well.

Things are really great. Work/love/art/family. Just scored a dream job. I'm being thrilled.

So of course, I am shaking, hypervigilant, watching and waiting for my enthusiasm and joy to become the dreaded hypomania, the one that releases the destructive impulses that sabotage lives. 

I've got the right meds, trying to get enough sleep, eat, reduce caffeine. But that asshole, mania, is coiled up outside my door like a pissed off snake. Crouching like a lion ready to eat my life.

Writing this is my little road sign to myself. Beware of falling rocks. Watch out, slow down. It's good, just allow it to be. It won't stay perfect, problems will arise. I will struggle with bad experiences too, eventually. Feelings are not permanent, and they are not facts. 

I feel a bit more in control! Thanks for coming to my TED talk."

I posted i was bipolar and before i was posting really good therapy advice and little memes for those struggling with mental illness and he said ""stop giving people ammunition to make fun of you ."" So i was coming out of psychosis a bit and he told me to delete it. But yet my sister is on everything because shes so amazing and im dog shit compared to her apparently.  I have schooling behind me and finished things.  Shes quit everything but married a cuck whose family comes from money with no work ethic. I want to get Facebook again to see people and motivate them with mental illness, then again all these people i could give a fuck about are on there and dont deserve my story.

My dad said he wouldn't mind if I quit, but I don't know what to do. I'm truly miserable and just need people to tell me what they would do if they were in my situation.

i also feel like i don't have a personality. i know, i know. it sounds ridiculous but i just got diagnosed with bipolar 1 back in december 2019. i'm still trying to separate myself from the mental disorder. i am on medication. for both my bipolar and generalized anxiety.

48681,bipolar,How to talk to someone in the middle of mania with hallucinations.,"I’m a pharmacist and one of my usual patients called me in the middle of florid mania with auditory and visual hallucinations. Her mania has been difficult to control but She’s in a safe environment so that’s not a worry. 

But she’s telling me things like her friend are trapped in her flashlight and drowning and she doesn’t want to be guilty of killing her friends and she needs to get them out.  Her cousins are in the mountain in sky and talking to her and she doesn’t want them to go away. This was never covered In schools so i kinda fumbled my way through best I could based on her reactions. She hung up in a better place I think n 

What’s the best way to talk to her to comfort her? Do I acknowledge her hallucinations as real? I was scrambling, I think I did ok but would like to be better prepared in the future. 

Thank you in advance and sorry if it used any non-current terms."
48682,bipolar,"My thoughts are turning darker, and I wrote a suicide note. Should I go to the ward?","I'm just dealing with a lot right now. I unearthed that my brother molested me when we were younger,  and my meds aren't adjusted quite right(my doctor and I wanted to try Latuda, but my insurance doesn't want to cover it unless I try a number of anti-psychotics first. Diabetes runs on both sides of my family, so we wanted to avoid the weight gain related drugs if we could. Unfortunately, this meant I'm back down to just Prozac and my transition meds). My job sucks. I don't feel like I'll ever accomplish anything or be happy.

Today I just couldn't handle it. Every fiber of my being wanted to get away, to just die. I considered buying a buck knife on my break to cut with, but I was too scared of getting in trouble with my higher ups to do so. On my lunch, I bought a couple pens and a notebook, hoping maybe if I wrote down how I felt, it would let me feel better.  


Instead I wrote a suicide note, explaining that I loved my family and friends very much, but my pain is too great, and detailing what I wanted done with my things and with my body(cremation and my ashes spread over Lake Michigan). 

I came home from work with a bag of KFC and talked to my grandma. She told me it might not be a bad idea to voluntarily go to the ward. But everyone I know that's been to the ward, herself included, makes me piss scared to do so.

Should I?"
48684,bipolar,Does Bipolar look like ADD?,"So as someone who is constantly trying to understand her mental illness I read a lot of different medical articles and so on. I have been diagnosed various things throughout my life. As a child I was diagnosed with ADD. Then as an adult it was bipolar. The types of bipolar and wording for my supposed mood disorder has varied. But as an adult ADD has never been brought up and overlooked as a diagnosis. 

But as I sit and try to think about my mental health and all of the notes I’ve taken so that I can pinpoint exactly what is wrong I feel less bipolar and more attention deficit. 

Now I’m not saying all bipolar is destructive but I’ve never had any destructive behavior. I’m hyper but I’m hyper almost daily. Unless I’m cycling mania. I can’t tell. 

I can’t pay attention to anything to save my life. My anxiety is so bad it crippling. I feel like I’m constantly on high alert and it seems like I’m never coming down. Even through depression I manage to get a lot done. I’m either highly focused on my brain is scattered. 

But these things both sound like it could be ADD and bipolar. This is why I’m not entirely convinced I’m bipolar. Even on medication nothing really changes. 

How can I express to my doctor to please try to treat me for ADD instead of or as part of my bipolar. Because I feel like the reason I’m NOT seeing much improvement despite constant medication changes and increase and tweaking is because doctors sort of refuse to treat adults for ADD because the medications for them can be highly addictive if abused yet I know I wouldn’t abuse them. Plus there are meds out there for ADD that aren’t addictive. I just want to get better. 

Thank you for letting me vent. I just feel frustrated."
48685,bipolar,The only advantage of depression for me is being completely desireless.,"Depression manifests practically as the exact opposite of my manic impulses: 

I don’t spend money. I don’t use drugs. I don’t make risky decisions. I have no libido, so I don’t have sex with strangers. I just don’t do anything. It’s horrible that I can hardly care for myself. But it’s good that I’m not usually at risk to myself, like in mania."
48687,bipolar,Found a generic Lamotrigine (Lamictal) that goes down easy and doesn't accidentally disgustingly start dissolving in your mouth,"I have a terrible time with a ton of lamicatal/lamotrigine tablets because a lot of them start dissolving in the mouth which tastes so bad I start gagging.  And that happens so often that I gag in anticipation and it's so much harder to get it down.  I found a great generic - but then because of covid virus affecting the ability to get ingredients for meds that generic company went belly up.  So for 5 months I have been gagging on pills and miserable.  

&amp;#x200B;

My pharmacy is really great and worked with me to find a new generic that doesn't start dissolving before it is swallowed.  After a few months of trial and error we found one that works great!  Just thought I would share so if you are like me and have trouble you can ask your pharmacy for the generic from this company instead of others.

48690,bipolar,Rapid cycling,"So I’ve been diagnosed Bipolar for years now, recently was told though it’s rapid cycling.  I have swings all the time, they can last as long as weeks, and as quick as minuets, high mania and low depressive episodes.  Does anyone else experience such rapid cycles?"

Idk what keeps happening to me. I’m having these spurts where I feel EXTREMELY passionately upset by something. I feel almost like nothing in the world has ever wronged me so intently in the moment. For example, last week I went OFF on this guy I was messing with as if he was the worst human to have ever existed because he didn’t text me back... This morning I almost got arrested for screaming at cops who pulled me over for a traffic ticket. Don’t get me wrong, they were being waaaay unnecessarily intimidating and hostile towards me for literally just running a stop sign and I was right to be upset but I literally left a voicemail to the chief of police and was ready to drive to the precinct to yell at his boss because the way they handled the situation. Just completely irrational but I felt i’d been so wronged it felt very reasonable.

I just woke up from a nap and now I feel like everything I’ve been doing lately (like those examples) was dramatic and unnecessary.... It’s hard to even remember all the details it feels kinda blurry like a distant memory. My emotions in the moment are sooo peaked. I felt a little lonely the other night and next thing you know i’m planning my suicide. I was sad about a boy another night and wrote a whole emotional ass journal entry in metaphors i thought could be a world winning fucking poem LMAO. (i posted it on a reddit poetry forum and nobody responded to it so i deleted it hahahha). Idk why I keep doing this... losing all rational thought in random bursts over little shit. I am on my period but it’s definitely more than that. Idk what’s going on. I’m scaring myself.

Note: i have been off my meds since january and had no issues until now. i know i should get back on them but now i lost my job over covid and don’t want to pay for a psychiatrist until i get a new one if possible :/

Please help 🥺"
48692,bipolar,Question about auditory hallucinations,"My wife has been hearing a ringing bell in the house for several days. At first I thought it could be one of the animals and have been trying to narrow down the source but today it happened again, she's alone on the couch with all 3 pets with her and she heard it in the other room.

For clarification I do not hear these at all and I've been with her when it happens.  I know it's not common but also not too rare for bipolar sufferers to experience hallucinations audibly.

Is this anything anyone has experienced? She's stated that she feels a manic swing coming and has been in a low for a couple weeks. Her anxiety is currently palpable and can be felt throughout the house.

Any help would be appreciated, I'm new here and just want to find some way to ease her anxiety."

48694,bipolar,DAE struggle with hobbies/passions,"I quit a job that was really detrimental to my mental health about 2 months ago, and since then I have had basically unlimited free time outside of job searching for 1 or 2 hours a day. It feels hard to really fill it with any kind of meaningful hobby or activity or whatever you want to call it. My entire life I have just kind of bounced around from one thing to another, never really investing any real time or effort into anything, and I'm at the point where it feels like there is nothing I will ever be able to do that is fulfilling, and that anything valuable I do create will just be luck of mania.

When I was 16, I made [this](https://soundcloud.com/gjbb/idontknowwhattoputhere) song in a weekend or so, and I can remember it feeling good to put the time into it, and even listening to it now, I genuinely really like it and think it is catchy and often times find myself just kind of humming the melody or whatever. But as I type this and I think about trying to make music again, it feels like this impossible mountain to climb that isn't worth the effort because even if I do put in the time, it is not like anyone is ever even going to listen to my music, let alone music becoming something I can support myself with. It feels like this was just a manic fluke.

Another thing I have spent a moderate amount of time on is fighting games, but even though I enjoy them, it feels like I'm never going to be a sponsored tournament player, or smart/funny/creative enough to be a commentator or content creator for them.

Last Christmas, I got a motorcycle and really enjoyed riding it around for 2 or 3 months, but now I don't feel any joy when I ride it any more.

Does anyone else struggle with this kind of stuff? It feels impossible to overcome the self-discouragement that I will never be good enough at anything for it to bring me joy on its own, financial boost, or any kind of respect. I can't keep myself from thinking that anything good I ever do will just be the manic outburst, not me."
48695,bipolar,What's the best way to support a bipolar family member?,"My sister was diagnosed as bipolar manic depressive a few years ago. After two psych ward stays it seems like the right kind of medication was prescribed and things were getting stable. She was actually taken off her medication because it was determined that as long as she stayed away from her triggers (weed, alcohol, stress, poor diet, poor sleep habits) she wouldn't have another episode, and the medication would do more harm than good if she stayed clean in that regard.

She now lives in a different state, this past week there have been signs that she might be slipping into another episode. We got a hold of her bf's number and he's taking her to go get checked out. Her episodes consist of mood swings, lack of sleep, hallucinations, and a tendency to 'wander'. It's been difficult for me to find a way to communicate with her and help her. I feel like if I say the wrong thing she'll close up and seclude herself which I don't want. It's a 7 hour trip from my city to hers so in the event of an emergency I can't act quickly. I feel powerless to help my little sister and I hate that. 

tl;dr: how do I support a family member, particularly when they're in another state?"

Don't get me wrong I am not gonna kill myself but I hope I stop existing somehow. Because i am not living I am just here like a chair. I can't feel a thing anymore I can't tell if I love someone or hate. Love of my life is ignoring me, I have no money, I am in a very crappy country everything seems bad. So why am I bothering to survive? I can't answer this question. Like I said I can't kill myself I am a coward. I don't even know why I am writing this. I know you will say hey man it will be okay etc. But I know nothing gonna be better everything is getting worse with time. I am just 20 years old but I am not wondering the years ahead of me cause I know every passing year it will be worse. I stopped taking my medication cause they don't do shit.

48699,bipolar,I feel like it makes sense... but I'm also kinda scared/worried?,"Hi friends, I (23 F) am seeking your advice/experience! I am recently diagnosed with OCD and suspected bipolar... still in process of figuring things out with my psychiatrist. Today is day 1 of abilify for me. She had me quit my daytime antidepressant of 2 yrs cold turkey because it was causing me to have severe manic episodes, and I am having a FUN time with withdrawal symptoms lmao.

I've suspected I had OCD for quite a long time, but bipolar blindsided me completely. Thinking about many specific events and general patterns in my feelings and actions in the past, however, it makes total sense. I just knew nothing about bipolar until my psych appt yesterday.

It feels so good that I finally might be on the path to managing my mental health in a more effective way. But I also know there are a lot of stereotypes and misconceptions about people with bipolar and I just don't know whether to tell anyone or not. (If I tell them, who might they tell? who else might find out? what will they think? my parents in particular have a history of dismissing my mental health problems as calls for attention [which is stupid because I am utterly introverted and hate being the center of attention]. But I also told them about my OCD and my mom is so concerned that she wants to attend one of my ERP sessions with me [no way that's happening].)

I feel like I'd feel really alone not having someone to talk about it with but I don't know how anyone will receive it and I don't know anyone else with it.

Anyone been in a similar situation with finding out their diagnosis? Did you decide to let anyone know? How did it go? Any and all stories and advice are welcome! Thanks in advance, friends!"

That same year I was diagnosed, because of a hell of an manic episode, medication was no where near working when she passed, and she was worried about me?! While she was dying. I'm stable and have been for years, loving life and wish she could see me now :)  
Anyways found this, wrote it shortly after her passing. Not trying to bring anyone down, live your life today is the message here.  


Time is not cruel, but...  
Time doesn't show mercy.  
Time doesn’t care what your plans are.  
Or what you’ve been through.   
If you lived a life of luxury or a life filled with hardship.  
Time cannot be persuaded, no matter how much you plead.  
Nothing can be given in exchange for time.  
Everyone around you had or have just that certain amount of it.  
Some are given very little, some are given a lot, in comparison.

It is the most valuable thing you can share with anyone.  
Make sure you have all the time in the world, until you don't.

48702,bipolar,Finally feeling normal,"My doctor put me on a new mood stabilizer (Lamictal 200mg)

A short time after taking this I became someone else. My mood and emotions were all over the place. I would become infuriated with the smallest inconvenience, I was constantly sick and stopped eating for the most part and to make things worse I stopped sleeping. I lost a good bit of weight and it felt like my brain was tingling. I shut people out and became self destructive to the point I quit my job

I dealt with this for two months and really felt like I wanted to die. Not self harm or suicidal I just wanted to stop feeling “crazy” and the doctor’s office wouldn’t take my calls because they felt like it didn’t warrant an “emergency” 

I finally got another appointment and went down to Lamictal 100mg

Today I finally feel normal. Today I was able to eat, I was able to talk with friends and family, I was able to finally be MYSELF again. I finally feel like I can keep going. I can’t get my job back but Im lucky I was able to hold on to most of my relationships. I know two months doesn’t seem that long and I feel for people who still haven’t gotten it sorted out.

I wouldn’t have made it without a specific someone who stayed with me at my worst point. I appreciate those who understand what it’s like.

Please reach out to someone you trust if you feel “crazy” Please don’t suffer alone. You are loved. It gets better."

I feel this induced manic episode which were medically induced and now have been prescribed mood stabilizers and being described as ""being on a bipolar spectrum"", I feel extremely frustrated by my experience with multiple psychiatrists over 3 years. Three years later i still have extremely low mood, supposed bipolar, worsened anxiety and resurfacing OCD. Are there people that have also had similar negative experiences and feel they were better off before ever seeing a psych doc? The past 3 years have been a huge emotional and physically draining experience and i have never felt this defeated and eroded in life. Im only 22 and i feel my wings were cut off before ever taking off.

50555,bipolar,Hypomania: Need for excessive stimulation?,"Hi all,

I'm not experiencing hypomania and I don't feel depressed, so I've taken some time to look back and think a little bit about some telltale signs of my hypomania. 

I work as a writer, and I have a few clients outside of the U.S. Because of this, my sleep schedule can be pretty erratic and I frequently go through periods of doing quite a bit of work at one time. For these reasons, it can be hard to know sometimes whether I'm just stressed and hyped on caffeine during a night of working-- and when I'm hitting on an actual episode of hypomania. 

It seems like one of the big tells is that I need *more* stimulation. When I'm just feeling happy and content, I'll sit and watch my favorite TV show. Or maybe I'll do some writing, or maybe I'll play a video game.

But when I feel hypomanic, it seems like I just want to be doing *more* at one time. So I'll work, but I'm so distracted I want to be watching TV. But I also want to be playing video games, and I also want to be learning how to play the guitar, etc. 

I almost feel trapped if I'm just watching TV or I'm just playing a game; I have a seriously increased need for stimulation. Realistically, this is good for my creativity but bad for my actual work. Trying to flip between writing essays and playing video games and learning an instrument doesn't do too well for productivity. 

Does anyone else feel this way, or is it just me?"
50556,bipolar,"2 days no weed, need support really bad right now","I've made the decision to stop smoking weed after being a daily smoker.

Have anyone else with bipolar ever quit weed cold turkey? Can you help me?"
50557,bipolar,Mood trackers,Hi everyone 42f relatively new at being diagnosed.  I'm seeking advice on app mood trackers.

Don't get me wrong I understand the reasons over this, but just wondering what else can't we do?"

Then, when I have an episode or just do something bizarre,  they are confused because why would I do this? I thought you were good now? Sorry, I'm as surprised as you are, but its all still very broken. The meds just make it easier to keep the car moving. Without them, the car doesn't slow down, or grind to a halt, it catches fire and melts down like chernobyl. Even I didn't know how bad I was until I got on meds. Everyone else surely has no clue. Most days it doesn't feel like there is a good reason to keep going,  but I know what despair truly feels like and I don't want to do that anymore. I want to suck some of the juice out of this apple before I come to my inevitable, untimely and mysterious death. Anything is better than going hollow."

I’m pretty stressed out and I’ve had a bad few days (a lot of tears and mild agitation). So my husband and I want to have a child soon. However, in 2019 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I started taking Latuda. Since the end of 2018, I’ve gained about 40 pounds. I stopped getting my period January of this year. I’m not on Latuda anymore, I switched to lithium and my prolactin levels are normal. All the blood work was normal except for my glucose levels (prediabetic). 

I did a provera test in May and I had some bleeding when I stopped taking it after 10 days, but still no regular period. My family doc asked me to go to a fertility clinic but I’m pretty upset because I was healthy and fit before all this medication stuff.

Do you think if I lose weight I might get my period back? I don’t have PCOS, my ultrasound was normal. 

Thanks!"
50571,bipolar,I’m not bipolar and my doctors are incompetent.,"I have now had two doctors diagnose me with bipolar 2 without any evidence nor history of hypomania or mania. I had a bad reaction to Lexapro (drove me into an even deeper depression), and started having very rapid mood swings after discontinuing. The doctor who prescribed it was unavailable, the doctor who told me to stop jumped immediately to Bipolar 2, and my now third doctor is piggybacking on that diagnosis instead of doing any actual work or analysis based on the symptoms I described and is pushing medication, despite agreeing that it probably wasn’t bipolar due to the lack of mania or hypomania. I have panic attacks on occasion, but that state of high anxiety never lasts more than a day or two at a time. Are they seeing something I’m not, or are they just taking the easy route with no regard for my well being just to say they are “treating” me? I’m happy to answer any further questions if I have not presented enough information, but it seems they’re ignoring Occam’s Razor and jumping to the obscure conclusion that it’s bipolar 2 with irregular symptoms."

I was diagnosed with a litany of disorders (depression, anxiety, ptsd) but I was truly bipolar. I have a 11 year old son who was recently diagnosed with fear of harm bipolar. Once I started to learn about FOH and I saw the same doctor as my son he diagnosed me with the same. 

FOH is different because there is a biological component to it as well. The brain has issue controlling temperature regulation. This presents with someone running hot all the time, sweating to death while asleep, needing cooling techniques to stay calm. There is so much that goes into it, but this diagnosis and proper treatment have made the world of difference. Its estimated by the juvenile bipolar research foundation that at least 2 million adults suffer with the phenotype of bipolar."

Basically I start to feel fuzzy in my head first, and then every time I move my head the world will start to spin. It affects my balance and usually I just go smoke, take a pill for vertigo, and sleep for 10 hours.

 I am usually too out of it to notice whether I'm in an up or a down swing, so I have no clue if it is related to my moods or not. I don't remember having them prior to being diagnosed and put on lamotrigine.

Also flipped off the police calling them putas (bitches). I thought I was a superhero, which them not pulling me over didn't help.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 only a couple of months ago. I'm still very new to taking medication and I'm still adapting to the lifestyle updates. 

So, my big old mistake that I need help correcting. I ended up having a hypermanic mood change for roughly about two weeks according to my mood chart, and I forgot to take my medication for a couple of days during this period. A big oh shit moment! I didn't exactly realise it at the time but I know the consequences of such a thing.

So, when I ran out I rang my chemist to have the next set made up. Only to be greeted with my mistake... They said they no longer had the script in and were really confused as to how I had fell behind. Me now realising my giant mistake had to accept the confusion of the chemist and dodge it until I could figure it out. 

I've made an appointment with my doctor but I still ain't exactly sure how to explain what happened??? What do I do as I'm really unsure? All I know is I have to be honest about it. Am I the only person to make this kind of mistake?

Thanks! Otherwise, I hope you all are feeling good. Stay strong champions! If I have broken the rules please feel free to remove this."

Then I was all oh I’m on lamictal so that caused me to lose like 10 pounds. Then I just blurt out “for my bipolar depression..” I blame my migraine brain not thinking. Then my migraine got worse 10 min after and I automatically felt a panic attack coming. So I logged off. 

Hopefully on the positive side.. I did text her and tell her to please not tell anyone because i didn’t mean to blurt that out and it embarrasses me. I still have not accepted the illness exactly and still feel like a freak. :/ I have bipolar depression and ADD. Thanks for listening.

My drinking problem was out of control, I would get drunk and have sex with strangers. I also started some projects, that's why I have a job right now which some people would love to have. I had grandiose delusions thinking I was so handsome and special. I was so euforic nothing could stop me.

52458,bipolar,"Type 1 Partner Is Wearing Me Out... Suggestions, Please?"," I (28, F) have been dating my boyfriend (30) for over 2 years. I own my house and he's been living with me for over a year. He works from home due to the pandemic and is expected to do so until next year. He is type 1 bipolar and takes daily medication for it (Latuda, Lamictal, Lamotrigrine I believe). I'm usually very patient and try my best to be understanding with him, and he has told me in the past when I notice he is showing symptoms of having a manic episode to tell him so he can better monitor his cycles and be more self aware. 

I have been pointing out to him that lately I think he's been having an episode, he keeps talking over people who clearly want to say something and then he'll talk so much that the person can't get one word in. He doesn't pick up when people are uncomfortable, it can be writtenall over the person's face and he'll just keep going. Today he did this with my mom and I could tell some things he said and how he was acting during our conversation made her uncomfortable, even though he wasn't purposely trying to say anything offensive. He does this with me often and it makes it hard to feel like I'm being respected during our interaction when he talks over me everytime I try to say anything. However, when I point out anything like this he gets upset - but why ask me to point it out then if I'm just going to get denial?

He has some anxiety quirks that make our home life difficult, too. He doesn't like to go out alone, even if he's just going down the street, and he'll make me go with him. If I tell him I don't want to go he'll either beg or bug me to go until I get so frustrated that I go just to get it over with. If I hold my ground and refuse to gi, he'll cry until I feel bad enough to go. He also does not like to be without me around the house. I tell him that I need to have some space because when i'm not at work I am with him all the time and it is not good for my overall well being to have literally no personal time to decompress. I've done everything from politely asking him to let me do my own thing around the house for an hour, to having a complete anxiety meltdown about feeling so stressed about it. I only ever get ""alone time"" when I take a bath and still he'll come in every few minutes and try to have a random conversation. 

I care about him a lot and want to help him but at the same time I feel like my own mental and physical health is being effected from trying to help him and make him feel better. I am so, so tired. I don't know how to get my own time from him without him taking it personally and getting very upset. Do you have any suggestions on how to help deal with feeling bogged down, and how to get my time without him feeling so negatively about it? Any advice is appreciated."
52460,bipolar,Medication dilemma,"Hi r/bipolar! After years of manic and depressive episodes I was diagnosed with cyclothymia (bipolar lite) about 6 months ago. I was prescribed Zoloft and Eftil. After reading about the side effects those drugs can have I decided it would be the best if I abstained from taking any. Well, now, after some time I am wondering whether I made a right decision. Without going into much detail, severity of my mood swings has affected the quality of my life, especially in the past year.

I've had contact with one girl that was (by my estimation, she didn't really talk about it that much) on medication for a more severe form of Bipolar disorder. Sadly, the drugs she's taking are making her into a very cold and distant person which really turns me away from taking any.

I'm not sure whether it's worth it. I quite enjoy my manic episodes from time to time and it's suffice to say that they make my life worth living. However the depressive episodes are just becoming unbearable... I don't want to be completely braindead but I also don't want the uncertainty of never knowing whether a depressive episode is going to come and ruin my plans and major moments in life.

Any and all advice is welcome as well as questions regarding the subject.

Thanks."

52469,bipolar,I did that stupid thing where I thought I wasn't actually Bipolar.,"I wasn't sure which tw tag to use but just as the title says. I stopped taking my meds because I was feeling fine only to end up on on a bender of chaos. 
It was so bad my boyfriend called the police on me because he didn't know what else to do since I was violent. I barely remember it except running and hiding in a tree for an hour. 
My best friend came and I had a full on breakdown screaming how I can't do this anymore and got to spend the past week in the psych ward. They tweaked my meds a little mainly for my normal anxiety I have. 
I feel so stupid and embarrassed to come back and have to face it all. I don't know. I just needed a place to say it. 


Tldr; tale as old as time. Went off my meds. Please don't go off your meds."
54365,bipolar,I got a job!!!!,I got a waitressing job at a local restaurant!!! I have zero experience so they are taking a chance on me. I feel so happy and excited and feel like things may be headed in a good direction for me. Just wanted to share with my peeps
54366,bipolar,"The ""Other Side"" [childhood mental/sexual abuse, self-harm, suicide and drug use warning]","Just wanted to share my story and say where I am now. 

I'm the product of teenage parents. My first experience with alcohol was when I was 6 months old. My father put his favorite German beer in my bottle. I was sick for a week. I have the typical ""urban American"" dad story. Most of my childhood was spent living with my mom and my grandparents. My grandmother is still one of my favorite people, my grandfather was the loud, toxic patriarch that seeped through the entire family. He had his moments of motivation and love but it was mostly a lot of unresolved anger that he took out on people close to him. Something I understood too well when I got older. 

When I was 10, my mother was fairly drunk. At some point in our conversation, I said ""I just wish I could see him more"", my mom took this an opportunity to visit my father who didn't want visitors. I told her at the time ""I don't think that would be a good idea"", even at a young age I was usually right about these things. 

I remember it was raining, we walked up to the staircase outside his house. My mom banged on the door multiple times, my father kept repeating how he didn't want to be bothered. I was at the bottom of the staircase a few feet behind my mother. My father eventually comes out, they yell at each other, he goes back inside. I remember being concerned he was going to grab a knife. 

I don't recall exactly what lead up to witnessing the violence but I remember it vividly. My dad grabbed my mom by her arm and by the neck, did almost a judo throw to her, seemed like her feet and the back of her head touched as she was slung over the railing, she slid down the railing and to the front of the steps. I don't remember her crying but I remember her being angry. On the way home I remember looking through blue and orange hues, the night sky and street lights,blurred, as I tried my best to remember the lyrics of ""No Limit Soldier"" by Master P. Tears were a sign of weakness. I didn't stop my dad. I didn't save my mom. I'm not Batman. I suck. 

Later in the summer of that year, I was playing in the front yard by myself. I went inside to play Ratchet and Clank on my PlayStation 2 I had gotten for Christmas. Before sitting down on the couch in my shorts and settling in for my favorite past time, I heard a knock at the door. 3 older girls, older than me but not adults, asked if I wanted to have a water balloon fight. ""Fuck yeah"". 

I remember them being very handsy in the way the way were playing. It was a lot of fun, until they told me to go in the back yard. They told me to sit ""Indian style"", criss cross apple sauce. One them pulled my shorts down, the 3 of them started ""playing"" with me. Nothing came out, they didn't care, they laughed about it, it felt good to make them laugh. I went home and didn't know what to feel. It felt good but it also felt off to me for me. I didn't understand why. I played Ratchet and Clank but couldn't focus on the boss I was playing against. I never told anyone till I turned 17. 

Age 11, I hooked up a shoelace to the ceiling fan, tied it around my neck and hopped off the top of the dresser. The shoelace snapped after a few seconds. I laid on the floor looking at the ceiling fan spinning and cried. Couldn't stop. I'm supposed to be a No Limit Soldier. Why couldn't I stop? 

A few days later my mom saw bruising on my neck. Thought it was hickey. I got a whopping. 

Ages 12-16 had their ups and downs. I moved to a bigger city, it was less black/white in the most literal and metaphorical sense. In the ""new city"", I felt I could be myself. I wouldn't be made fun for watching Sailor Moon. People thought that it was cool that I started playing guitar and stopped playing football. I dyed my hair blue and blonde. It helped me grow without the fear of being bullied. 

During this time I met a girl, we became friends through another girl I had a huge crush on. She reminded me of Buttercup from Power Puff girls. Sophomore of high school we become a thing. My mother wouldn't come till 2 am some nights and when she did she would knock on the door, drunkenly ramble about the issues of her life. When she was sober, I was in constant fear of being screamed at for a piece of trash being on the floor or being in the shower too long or whatever it was. In other news of my upbringing, the sky is blue. My girlfriend's family became the family I always wanted. I would spend friday-sunday. My mom didn't care. 

Eventually, I lost my virginity to her. We were weird and I wanted kids at the time. She thought it would be funny to keep the condom wrapper and put it in a scrapbook to gross out our kids. One day, the wrapper fell out of her purse while her mom was cleaning her room. He parents disowned me and didn't allow us to speak. The support I always wanted was taken away from me. I didn't deserve it. 

We talked on e-mail and what not anyway. 

In my emotionally damaged hormonal teenage mind, I thought it would be wise to start cutting to myself to feel closer to her. If I can't be with her at least I can feel the same pain. When I was 15, I took a bath. I played the saddest most emo song I knew, I started up at my shoulder, worked my way down to my wrist, turned the blade up and down. I didn't wanna be a soldier. I didn't wanna be anything.

As I worked myself up to go ""down the street"", BANG BANG BANG. 

My mom is at the door. The music is too loud and I need to walk to the local bar to drive her car back to the house. Guess I'll go do that. 

Ages 17-20 has ups and downs. I meet a girl on tinder. She's very sweet. We talk till 5 am the next day. We date 2 years. Move in together. 

I won't speak down on her or tell her story. I will say that she reminded me of my mother, the way she told me I needed to change my meds or get therapy or I was being controlling when I mentioned to her ""hey, maybe you should get therapy"". I never was able to get the space I asked for. 

Over time, I resented her and I resented myself. I took that out on her and myself. I started drinking and smoking weed (possibly unknowingly smoking k2/deuce from time to time) and my mania (which I was not yet aware of at this point) had me sleeping for two hours. I became my mother and my grandpa. I was emotionally abusive, never physical. I screamed constantly. I punched holes in the wall. I threw a litter box once. I was irrational to say the least. 

In the latter half of our 4.5 year relationship, I was 302'd twice due to extreme psychotic episodes. I went through the medical carousel. We dated off and on. I was diagnosed with BPD and bipolar 1. Last year, I had a few drug induced hallucinations, was in a few residential treatments but still was depressed to the point of only leaving bed for food and the bathroom. I had a growth on my head that had developed into MRSA infection. My family told me I had to leave the place I was living and go to the shelter or go to the hospital. I picked the hospital. Had I not, chances are I would of died from my infection. I would of been okay with that at the time. 

From Dec-Feb last year, I was in mental health treatment. I spent Christmas Day and New Year's at the hospital. I was in residential treatment, sober, and worked through a lot of things with an angel of a therapist. CBT was what I was always striving for but it finally stuck. My ex and I stopped talking shortly before my treatment. 

I've been in a homeless shelter since Feb. I got a job in April and I've been the happiest I've ever been in my life. I'm getting an apartment soon. I'm looking forward to that. I'm working on changing my meds and I've been able to manage things better. 

During my most recent relationship and up to and beyond, I made an effort to learn myself. I wasn't mad at her most of the time I was mad because the smell of pizza I ate as a kid lead to my body responding poorly or because I needed to sleep or because something she would do something totally normal that would remind me of one of the girls from my youth. Recently, I've have learned myself. I love physical intimacy but that intimacy doesn't come with emotional connection, I love video games, I love pro wrestling, I love being creative but only for myself, I love helping people figure out their own issues, I love cooking, I love politics and world history, I love binging tv. 

It took 26 years. 26 years of misdirected anger, 26 years of not realizing I'm allowed to cry, 26 years of letting people disrespect my boundaries, 26 years of being impulsive or depressed, 26 years of trying to be someone I'm not but for the first time in my life, I feel in control. I feel in control of my future. I feel in control of my thoughts and actions. I feel in control of who I want to be and who I am. I'm actually a human being. 

Do I have guilt and shame over things I did when I was unhealthy? Of course but I'm also not that person anymore. I've made efforts to make apologize and make things right. I deserve to happy because I didn't choose to exist. I did what I did. Can't change it. I can continue to change myself. 

My mom and I have had the best relationship we've ever had since she got sober. My dad and I got really close after I turned 22. 

I'm always going to be bipolar. I'm gonna have days where rage is simmering on my mind but I'm gonna hit a punching bag or play guitar to let it out rather than scream at my mom for all the things she did when she didn't have her own stuff together. I'm gonna have days where I'm sad where I'm gonna cry and listen to My Chem and sit in a dark room with by Christmas light or talk my friends about my feels rather than cut myself and think about ending my life. I'm gonna have days where I'm happy and be social and go out of my way to make as many people smile as I can instead of run around and get weird and mad for whatever unknown reason. 

For the first time in my life, I'm comfortable with the idea of the universe taking me away when it's my time instead of on my own terms. It's exciting, it's sad, it's scary and wonderful all at the same time. 

For me, it's always gonna be a journey. The road has been rough but as time progress the path has gotten much smoother. I'm learning who I want love from, I'm learning what I want to do with my career, I'm learning what it means to me to be a ""man"". 

I'm not a No Limit Soldier. I'm a peacekeeper who is allowed to cry and wants to be Batman. I'm a nerd who wants 2 pitbulls, a cat and few reptiles. I'm an intellectual who wants to fight for people rights and help others figure themselves out cause I couldn't do it for so long. I'm a dork who likes the absurdity that is Orange Cassidy vs Pac. I'm a lover who likes to tell people how great they are and maybe make them feel a little bubbly from their head to their toes if they want that. 

I'm a traveler. 

It took me a long time, a lot of second guessing and going backwards but I'm finally on the other side of the bridge. I wanna keep seeing more destinations. 

I feel okay with that now. I hope reading this makes you feel a little more okay too."
54367,bipolar,Never thought to search reddit for a group like this,"I was diagnosed with bipolar/manic depressive/ADD when I was younger. I hate labels, I hate the psychiatry practice and how its incentivised to diagnose kids with these things and load them up with meds. However.

For better or for worse, I feel myself sometimes(even alot of times) doing things that would look bipolar. So Im going to treat myself as such, until I stop acting this way.

I blew up at some guys at work today, and the engineers that we work with. My manager had my back, but Im still troubled with how I expressed myself. Everytime this happens, I promise myself Im going to keep my head down and shut up like I used to do in grade school. Then I see something stupid happen at work, that shouldve been fixed already, and I blow up/ talk shit/ act manic. 

I fucking love my life. And I fucking hate it. And after getting my dream job(or halfway to it), those two extremes have been amplified. 

For those of you that can relate, Im glad you think about these things. Im glad you post about these things. Im glad I found you."
54370,bipolar,um... a setback has occurred,"so ive been 8 months self harm free and today i broke that. i feel so ashamed and i dont know what to do about that. my poison was smilies bc they aren’t as noticeable but still do the trick &amp; i have access to lighters. i had a super rough night and i dont blame it on the people involved i entirely blame myself. i did this to myself. im stronger then this, and from now on ill work harder to prevent this from happening again. ill talk to my counsellor abt it next week, but my family and friends don’t know about this so i can’t confide in them. does anyone have any tips on this? if you made it this far thanks for taking the time to read, and have a great day/night. ❤️"
54371,bipolar,Recently diagnosed and it gave me perspective of times I've ruined relationships because of the illness.,"I pushed away a lot of good people. I was convinced people who cared about me didn't like me. I got angry and irritated and little things they'd do because I was so toxic. I imploded. I exploded. I overreacted and just cut them out, causing drama that's lasted for half a year.

I can't reach out to them and say, ""Sorry turns out I'm crazy and was just untreated. Haha still friends?"" reaching out will do no good and just open old wounds.

I'm afraid of it happening again, and I don't know how to become a better person. I've been on seroquel for two weeks now, with a cocktail of antidepressants, anti-anxiety, and vitamins every night before I go to bed. I don't know what this means for my future, but I'm scared.

I don't want to push everyone away until I'm alone, but I'm just terrified I'll keep doing it when I get in a down. I even pushed my therapist away and stopped going 2 weeks ago. 

I don't know if I'm worth helping sometimes."
54372,bipolar,I am honestly stable but I can't stop talking. I have been a talker my whole life.,"My best friend and I had a fight today and when he apologized he told me I was one of the most sensible people he knew, I just talk way too much. he would not have said this about me 5 to 10 years ago but today I agree with him. Talking is seriously my favorite thing to do when I find a person interesting. I can be very reserved because of my anxiety to people I don't know yet or don't find it interesting. My question is if this talkative while stable quality it's a bipolar trait. I mean I know it is when a person is having symptoms but once you're as cured as you're going to get, is it normal to still be talkative? I have bipolar 1 with features."
54374,bipolar,Parents kicked me out. On the verge of going mixed. Help/advice really needed rn.,"Hey guys. I made a post a few days ago talking about my mishap with my Ex. Pretty messy made me manic to the tits. 

Anyway... So my mum lost the plot. I was hypomanic, enjoying life, making friends at my uni. Feeling really accepted. I even quit cigarettes and the day I did I went on the patch. There were no cravings of nicotine at all and once again I was elated from being hypo. She immediately forced me to buy a pouch of rolling tobacco, being the hypo and impulsive person I am I ran to the shops. During the week I also quit alcohol which was going great but the second my mum brought wine into the house she kept urging me to drink (when I actually want alcohol she treats me like a drug addict that just takes takes takes) so I found that to be odd. 

She proceeded to say that we needed to have a chat about my behaviour over the last few days. I had wrote a book, an essay and a speech + I emailed my old uni about doing a de-stigmatisation on Bipolar, OCD etc. It was an extremely productive and happy week.

What proceeded after that was she sat me down, and started yelling at me. Calling me selfish, cruel, mean etc. Once again, I had only been nice and maybe a little talkative that week. I get elevated and stormed off cause tf? Anyways I went to my car and she said ""If you get in that car we are calling the cops and saying it was stolen"" 

No joke she actually called the cops on me so I drove back. She went on saying that they were gonna throw me in the looney bin and arrest me. When they came they were extremely empathetic and actually took me to the hospital where I finally got my foot fixed (I broke it shortly after my ex left cause I kicked a fence post in delirium).

So now I'm in my uni's study hall, no where to go, no one to call and no money. My ex called me today of all days and screamed my head off about embarrassing her for telling my story about how I got manic to you guys. I didnt mention her name or anything that could be tied to her. Now she wants a restraining order and I cant have that because my only place I could go is my Grandmothers and she is a foster carer so I need a clean criminal record. 

Guys, I need help. The fuck do I do? My mum is patronising me, my Ex is tearing my heart out more, my Dad for once isnt helping. 

Honestly at this point if I dont trigger proper mania I think I might actually kill myself this time. Fuck, im so lost. so so so lost."
54375,bipolar,Does anybody else do what we're not supposed to?,I not only take in nicotine like water but also have a bad pop (caffeine) addiction.  Does anyone else have these issues?  I tend to mess up my sleep a lot too.
54376,bipolar,Physical Fatigue in a Manic/Hypomanic episode?,"Does anyone else ever have physical fatigue during mania or hypomania? Like, for me my legs will give out because I overexert myself too much and neglect to feed myself as I forget. Does anyone else have this during mania or hypomania or is this just me?"
54378,bipolar,My mental health ruined my family,"My 23 year old son blames me for his PTSD from my multiple overdose, hospital stays, and he blames me for his anorexia.  Which I just found out that today. I have always tried my best to raise my kids. All my kids have seen therapist to help them work through it. I thought things were better but he calls me a terrible mom and it's breaking my heart.  

I'm married to a wonderful man now and I see a therapist 2 times a month.  I've held a full-time job for 2 years, I take my meds pretty regularly,  and I am really proud of not being in a hospital for 2 years. I'm heart broken. But I'm glad he is talking to me about it but god it hurts. I feel like if I'm so terrible why should I be here. I just want to die.

I would like to know if anyone has been through this? What was the outcome? What do I do?"
54379,bipolar,Looking for a bipolar support group,"Hey all, I want to find an online bipolar support group that has meetings. I was looking at [intherooms.com](https://intherooms.com) because my family is really familiar with 12-step groups but addiction isn't really my issue. I'm looking for a group so that I can hear stories from other bipolar people and not feel so alone"
54380,bipolar,I don’t want to be on lexapro/ssri/snri because i want to be able to orgasm. unfortunately i’m a minor and i live with my parents. what do i say to not take the meds,"they’re putting me on a low dose, which means that it’s going to affect my sexual performance, and idk what to do. my parents have NO IDEA and would FREAK OUT if they did. pls help"
54381,bipolar,"I took lithium for 15 days, stopped a week ago and have never felt such a terrible depression as now. Is it normal? ￼","I think only now I know what depression  really is.

I had to stop it because I was feeling too emotionless and getting fat, doctor changed to sertralina 50mg, but I don't know if I want to keep in this treatment, I regret the day I decided to see a psychiatrist... it kind worsen everything.  I wasn't like that! And before lithium I tried escitolapram, but it made me very suicidal, anxious, agited...
I'm not bipolar, but I know lithium is used most by bipolar patients

Please tell me this severr depression caused by lithium will go away

I can't even get up to eat or take a shower"
54382,bipolar,I had a severe manic episode now I’m in another state at a bar during a pandemic.,"Throwaway account for privacy. I woke up Wednesday morning and had a strong cold brew from Starbucks and some weed. It triggered mania and I put some stuff in a suit case and got on a train from Seattle where I live to Portland, Oregon. All the hostels were closed but I managed to find a cheap hotel for the night. I bought an airline ticket one way to San Francisco the next morning and here I am in California for the second night. I’m at a bar because I’ve been feeling so depressed and drinking and weed are the only things that seem to relieve the pain. I told my work I was checking myself into a psychiatric hospital and they believed me. My job is protected through a disability program in my state so I have a job if I come back. I’m running out of money and I won’t be able to pay rent this month. I can’t take care of myself enough anymore and I’m scared of what I’m capable of doing. I need help but I don’t know where to turn. This pandemic has messed me up 10X how much messed up I already was before. I don’t want to kill myself because I’m afraid of death, so I thought this was a better alternative—just getting away, that is. I need help."
54383,bipolar,"Microdosing as a therapy, have you tried it? Anything I should know?","Hey all...

So recently I came across someone who has supposedly worked with many people, including those with mental illnesses, to help them by microdosing and other nontraditional methods.

She said she could help me out. Specifically with shrooms in a three week long regiment.

If people could give mw information or input so I could make a well thought out decision I'd be GRATEFUL! Tell me your experiences.

I'm fairly stable atm and my main concern is potentially triggering mood instability/any time of episode."
54385,bipolar,I don't even know,"I just... I don't know what's wrong with me. Like I do, but I don't. The past week I have been feeling good and now... it just all comes crashing down. I'm at the point where I just feel empty not even sad, I can't even cry. Like so empty it makes me not want to live. It makes me want to quit my job and sleep all day, I don't know what will help. I just don't know why i'm living if I am going to feel like this my whole life, i don't think it's worth it, and i'm too scared of the pain that happens if I try to ever hurt myself. I want to think that there's a higher power that will help me or be there for me, but i just don't think that's the truth. I have no one to turn to, not my family, friends, therapist. Nobody understands or can make me feel comfort. Anyways, I know I am going to get in trouble for posting this but I just don't know what to do at this point.

My event is black tie and I couldnt find a dress that im comfortable in, and then out of the blue a cousin of mine asked me if I was pregnant. I don't know why im breaking down over this because I want kids and im in a position that its not a huge burden if I was. Im like 90% sure im not as a side note. But today as a day has just sucked.

54388,bipolar,The fires are tearing us apart.,"Hi hello

I feel so powerless right now. I feel like even though I'm in a depressive episode right now, I should be crying about this and not how I'm feeling now. I'm so upset. I feel so lonely and ignored. I feel like I'm in a completely different dimension.

My husband (23) has a pretty intense job, and due to the California fires around Berryessa lake (the LNU fire complex) his workplace is at risk of burning down - for reference, he works outside on a rented piece of farmland testing drones for medical aid.

Combined with him having his noise-suppressing earbuds in constantly, looking at his phone or being on his work PC constantly, and lack of affection, I don't know how to deal with feeling so alone. I want to garden and be outside but the smoke is too much. I want to be with family, whether it's his or my own. At least I wouldn't have to repeat myself multiple times and get hugs or even just have a conversation.

I wish he would go to therapy, even just once. I've tried so many times and he's convinced me so many times that he'll go. I think he's anxious right now. About his work burning down, about having to evacuate, about everything, combined with Covid making things more difficult. I think this is the most anxious he's ever been but he won't let me in, not even a little bit. I've sat him down more times than I can count so he'll talk to someone, anyone, about how he feels.

I feel so helpless because of my bipolar. I need more meds or something but I can't because I might get the rash from Lamictal if I increase too fast. I feel so out of control from everything. He pushes me away without saying a word or doing a thing, being nice to me like he's on autopilot.

I just need someone next to me that I know and love to talk to and smile with. I'm in a loop of having hope every new day and ending each day curling up on the couch alone.

You can see why I may think I don't have bipolar, that I'm messed up in a way I can't express. I'm depressed but I'm angry. I want to cry but I can't. It's hopeless no matter what I try. I feel hopeless. I feel like I'm beginning to slip back into my eating disorder, if not then my self esteem is plummeting. I know he's just anxious and can't catch a break, but I just want to hug him and be hugged back. I feel like I'm not enough. Too ugly or too fat. Not enough.

I wish I was stable. I wish these meds were enough to fix this. The ritalin helps center me for just a little while. I want to do stuff with him, not next to him. I'm worried my hallucinations are going to start again. I need to talk to my psychiatrist."
54389,bipolar,Sedating antipsychotics,"Hi guys, i have bipolar and severe insomnia (3+ days awake at a time) i need to get sleep cause im in a very tough college program. I was on seroquel, developed a bad allergic rash. Got switched to zyprexa, also developed a rash. Me and my doctor are both out of ideas on what to try next but i need some ideas asap. Which antipsychotics other than seroquel and zyprexa have you tried that have sedating effects??"
56310,bipolar,Can I still smoke weed while BP1?,"I'm bipolar 1 and my first manic episode was partially induced by smoking heavy amounts of weed. My second episode however was caused by lack of sleep and stressfulness. I have a job now that isnt stressfull and now I'm on 15 mg of Abilify, I've been taking one hit from a one hitter every weekend. Is this safe? I really miss smoking weed like I did before my first manic episode, but I dont want to induce another."
56311,bipolar,Anyone on venlafaxine or “Effexor xr”?,"I just wanted to know what you’re experience was/is like on this med?

I’m on lemictal 200mg twice a day and Seroquel 50mg once a day. To sleep she says.

Since taking the Seroquel man I just sleep and sleep. I could get more than enough sleep and still be tired the next day. I like that it helps me sleep but to feel so tired the next day sucks.

This is why Effexor was added to my “plan” I guess to not make me tired the next morning/day. Also back down to 25mg of Seroquel instead of 50mg.


I do just hope it works out. The trial and error of meds is getting fucking annoying. My medical bills are getting insane but I’m still doing what I have to do to get “better” “normal” or what have you.

Just looking for something about this new med combo."
56312,bipolar,Coming to realizations about my relationships,"Just a stream of consciousness really.

So, the past month or so has been pretty horrible for me. I've been out of treatment for a long time as I didn't have health insurance for a while after finishing grad school, but I'm back in now. I'm back on meds and have made contact with a therapist, but no appointment yet. Unfortunately, it seems like these things seem to take forever. All that being said, I need some help while I'm waiting for the meds to work and to get into therapy. So naturally, at least for me, I've been relying on friends a lot.

Apparently I've been too reliant. I think most people are afraid to see me when I go too far in either direction. Not because I'm like violent or anything, but I mean as well all know it IS scary. I don't really need to talk through my feelings very often, but being physically alone is pretty brutal for me when I'm depressed. I keep trying to make plans or just straight up ask people to come be with me, but everyone's too busy even after I make them aware of my situation.

I have two friends that I love. They ARE family to me. I don't have a very strong connection to my bio family and I very actively leave them in the dark about my mental health because they make it worse. But these friends have their own families and boyfriends and friends. They don't see me the same way that I see them. I'm not their brother. Our friendship does have some bounds because of gender. Which is definitely not to say that they don't love me, they just do differently. Probably more healthfully (grammar?). Provided I can make sure I'm doing it in a way that's not toxic, I'm going to continue to love them the way that I do. I don't think you can say you love someone and then put a bunch of conditions on it. They aren't doing anything wrong. They aren't treating me poorly. I'm just not the most important thing in their lives all the time. Unless I'm in danger, I suppose there's no NEED to interrupt their lives to be with me. One of them has an important, essential, stressful job and I don't expect or want her to over-exert herself because of me.

Ultimately, the conclusion that I came to is that I am alone. At least for now. I've never had a relationship of any kind in which both parties cared for each other in the same way. I've never met someone who loves the same way I do. Nobody has ever put me first the way that I put everyone else first. That's probably because I'm doing it wrong. So either I make peace with that or fundamentally change myself. I like the way that I love though, so I'm going to choose the first option. I think I need to put boundaries on myself and start prioritizing myself more often, but overall I like me. 

I don't know why, but I calmed down a lot when I came to this conclusion. I guess not truly alone as I do have people that care about me, but there's nobody in my life that's similar to me or that really gets me. Maybe I'll meet someone like me someday; that'd be kind of cool. I also kinda hope I don't though because then it almost feels like I'm wishing my condition onto someone else which is definitely not the case.

Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to get this out into the world. If you bothered to read through everything, does this resonate with you at all?

ALSO: just joined the community recently and it is super cool to be here so far. Thanks for existing!"
56313,bipolar,Current fixation,So I am heading toward the point if no return on my current fixation. I feel the need to have a new project to keep the depression at bay.  This time it happens to be a new fish tank project (not that it really matters). Starting to feel that edge if giving up on it and crashing or spending money I shouldn’t and causing another problem with my SO. As obviously this is a reoccurring problem. Either way not looking forward to the fallout.
56314,bipolar,Coming up with project ideas with other people while hypomanic/manic and then realizing you don't actually want to do it but have to now.,"This kind of sucks. Having all those ideas when manic and then realizing much later exactly how hard these things are, but then having roped other people into these ideas they now just actually have to be accomplished somehow."
56316,bipolar,I might be having a mixed state episode,"How do you differentiate between substance induced states and bipolar like symptoms? I’m coming to the realization (I’ve had this realization a few times before) that I’m probably bipolar. 

Additional pertinent information about me: I’ve been diagnosed as being on the Autism Spectrum, I have been diagnosed once as bipolar II though not by my current healthcare providers, and I’m on a rather tame prescription amphetamine binge plus one night of no sleep during a period of depressive symptoms for the last few weeks and two months now of unemployment. I also take antidepressants, memantine, and quetiapine. I’m thinking the only reason I’m coherent enough to post this is due to the memantine, quetiapine and the social support I received from the friend I called recently.

Edit: I just want clarification on how best to distinguish the difference between substance abuse related states and bipolar states if there is one in this instance."
56317,bipolar,Hi. I am in mania. 😂🤣,That’s all
56318,bipolar,Is this bipolar or am I just a bitch?,"I know bipolar is classified by the manic/hypomanic episodes. I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder jury is still out on if it's 1 or 2. Anyways, since I was diagnosed I've started feeling everything way stronger than I did before. I get this rage of anger over things that don't matter or start crying over nothing. I feel like I'm PMSing all the time. Today the dog had an accident in the house and I punched a hole in the wall. I've never had things affect my emotions this way. But it doesn't really count an a manic episode because they're short bursts of emotion and once I've calmed down I don't have any symptoms of mania. I'm working really hard on controlling myself but I just feel so out of control when it happens. I'd this part of being bipolar? Am I just a raging asshole? Is it something else? Could my meds be causing this?"
56320,bipolar,Hospitalized,Anyone here that have been hospitalized on a 51/50 due to your bipolar? How do you face friends or even speak to them. I have lost all ability to speak to the ones I know. Any thoughts
56321,bipolar,Any experience with Nasonex (Mometasone)?,"Without boring you with a long medical history, I was referred to a Respirologist after some odd findings in a lung CT.  I suffer from dust and pollen allergies, which means twice a year I can't breathe through congestion, and rather than use vasoconstrictors for 3-4 weeks again he sent a prescription for Nasonex (corticosteroid) for this fall's fun.

Haven't found any concrete studies either way, just anecdotal reports on medical sites.

Hage been stable for 4 years on Wellbutrin XL and Seroquel XR.  Already scheduled to see my psychiatrist a couple weeks into allergy season for my regular follow-up appointment.

Any one have comments or experience with Nasonex or another nasal corticosteroids?"
56322,bipolar,This disorder helped make me fat and now I’m constantly harassed because of it,"It’s a mixture of bad choices influenced by a depression episode and reasons out of my control. I was fit last summer during a hypomanic episode then I went through a following depression episode last fall/winter and gained 30lb through binge eating. Hovered there. Then got meds adjusted to change to latuda and gained another 20lb despite efforts to lose weight. Since gaining this weight here are some of the comments I have gotten:

I don’t have to gain I just watch you gaining.

Do you workout in the same clothes? Wow they must really stretch out.

I just really wonder what happened to you between Summer and now.

You lost 15lb? Where do you think you lost it?

Do you think your boyfriend would be more attracted to you if you lost weight?

Etc. And a lot of comments on I should exercise and eat better even though I’ve been doing that for a long time. I just couldn’t lose it no matter what I did. Finally my psychiatrist adjusted my meds to reduce the latuda a little and added topiramate, I got even more strict about eating healthy and IF and increased exercise even more. So yes now I’ve lost 15lb.

So I was feeling proud of myself yesterday. FINALLY. I finally felt just a LITTLE bit good about my progress because I can’t tell you just how disgusting I’ve felt with myself. 

And then my coworker notices my 5k shirt at the very end of my shift.

“You know you should really get back in shape. Everyone has problems and they just deal with it. But you got this way because you went home and ate.”

So I had to sit in the parking lot and cry for a while before being able to drive home. I feel so bad about myself and I’m working so hard and it doesn’t matter I’m just knocked down constantly. I hate this. I hate needing medications. I hate being mentally ill.

Thanks for reading to the end if you did."
56323,bipolar,I GOT A JOB,"that is all! 

this means ill have insurance again and can see my doctors again and get back on my meds!!!!!!

56324,bipolar,Am I hypomanic or just in a good mood?,"My doctor just diagnosed me a couple weeks ago and I’m still titrating to 200 mg of lamictal. I’m on the 3rd week and I’ve been in a good mood. 

Yesterday I have the final stage of an interview for a job I really want. Afterwards I felt really good, like high, and had a burst of energy the rest of the day. But then I started to feel really irritated for no reason, it almost feels physical to me. I felt like I wasn’t going to be able to sleep so I took a trazadone (prescribed). 

Today I woke up with energy and went for a bike ride and cleaned my apartment. Im in that mood where I want to reach out to everyone I know and see how they’re doing. Could this just be a good mood or is it the beginning of a hypomanic session?"

I’ve been struggling to the point I almost admitted myself into a hospital. I had my suicide letters ready. But I have hope. I can do this!"
56327,bipolar,Klopin - Silver Bullet,"I’ve posted about this once before and wanted to elaborate - here goes: I was previously diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and recently had that changed to Major Depressive Disorder with an Anxiety Disorder / OCD. One of the several medications I take at bedtime is Clonazepam to help me sleep. During the day I take Ritalin periodically to counteract fatigue. Long story short: on occasion I have taken Clonazepam during the day during periods of acute anxiety AND it is like a miracle drug. When my anxiety is alleviated I can get an immense amount of tasks accomplished that otherwise would be monumental, even with Ritalin. I only take it during the day infrequently and am concerned to tell my doctors because I am only supposed to take it at bedtime. I wondered if anyone else on here has had similar effects? Do you know why such bouts of productivity are possible? My goal is to achieve this effect without medication."
56328,bipolar,Getting dependent on cannabis to cope with symptoms?,"**I'm an adult in California.*

I don't know how much is quarantine but I'm so stressed and restless these days I can't go a day without smoking or I get deeply anxious. Its the only thing that chills me out whether its mania or depression I'm trying to kill. I just feel like I'm numbing myself 24/7 and it feels problematic. I'm even having a few drinks on weeknights where I previously never drank alone.

Is anyone else just like, totally overwhelmed by the world right now and using substances too much?"

56330,bipolar,Medication Interaction Question,I’ve been taking Lamictal (200mg ER) for about three years and I’m about to start taking Seroquel (50mg). I live in a recreationally-legal state and have used cannabis pretty much daily since I started the Lamictal with no problem. Does anyone know what might happen if I smoke cannabis while I’m on Seroquel? Has anyone ever taken these three in combo?
56331,bipolar,I cant stop blinking,I take Ziprasidone and Lamictal and I can't stop blinking and I dont know what to do. I think it's a side effect from the Geodon/ziprasidone. I called my psychiatrist and he said I need to talk to an eye doctor before he will recommend changing medication. I dont even know if this symptom will go away even if I change meds. I just dont know how to deal with this. I'm slowly losing the ability to keep my eyes open. Fuuuuuuuuuck me
56332,bipolar,I don't know if ill ever function in a job and that scares me,"I've ghosted so many jobs because I couldn't get out of bed, or I had a mixed episode where I was just so agitated and freaked out i couldn't function. 
I had one job where I thought j was doing good, I'd called out too much but I was still getting good feedback, and since it was a smaller business I was actually able to contribute ideas they began implementing.
Then one day I went in and they called me back to fire me on a Monday morning. 
The manager said to me ""you do a great job when you're here, but if you're not more consistent nobody will ever want you,"" n I hate it because I know in my heart she's right
When I'm depressed is hard to get out of bed, and I'm petrified at the ide of crying at work
When I'm manic I can't STAND any downtime and in retail there is a lot of downtime, no matter whT anyone says and I cannot stand boredom,  I need something to do
I'm so scared of the prospect ill never be consistent and reliable enough for the people I love. Statistics terrify me. Sayi g that the likelihood of me having a good career, a healthy relationship, are low.
It makes me feel so utterly helpless I feel like I'm chokjng
I just sit and wonder some nights why I'm here. If I'm going to be a burden forever that I should end it now."
56333,bipolar,I expressed my feelings tonight and it was very hard. But I’m proud of myself.,"I had a sit down with my husband and I told him I needed to get this feeling off my chest: insecurity.
I’ve lost myself, and loving myself.

Coming forward with my feelings is the hardest thing I can ever do as I tend to repress anger. It turns to bitterness, resentment, and rage which eventually unfolds in the ugliest way. I promised to be better.

So I did do better. After four major fights in one year and being deathly afraid of myself and the destruction I cause each time— it felt so damn empowering to be able to confess this.

Since our last fight I’ve also been consistently taking my pills for the last 6 weeks. I will admit I’ve been feeling irritable the last few days but Yay! I did it!"
56334,bipolar,"The last week has been really rough, but after playing A Short Hike and being mellowed out, I started Sea of Solitude and that intro shook me.. honestly these might be the perfect games for me in bad times.","Still a hard week but it passes the time and takes me out of my head and hopefully in a more Zen space.

Anyone here have some good games, movies, music, books, activities and anything in general that does this for you?"
58280,bipolar,"Anyone else cringe/get irritated with ""You Can Talk To Me"" posts?","Whenever I see someone share one of those **""yOu cAN tALk To mE""** posts, I can't help but roll my eyes and feel a little disdain in my heart bubble up.

I do feel like there are certainly people out there who genuinely want to be someone that people can feel comfortable around and talk to about suicide and self harm, but I've often found that those types of people are not those that post these sorts of things. They are the people who are present and are able to sit through the discomfort with you, who actively choose to do that.

idk, It just feels fake an insincere to me. We live in a society where people think that those of us with mental illness can't see through these types of thoughtless attempts to ""reach us"" and ""support us."" I'm tired of shallow and action-less words, and it drains my energy when I see these types of things.

Anyone else eye-roll at these kinds of post?"
58281,bipolar,hypersexuality,"Disclaimer: I am not in a manic episode and haven't had one for years, and this has nothing to do with my username.

Here goes. I have always been a more ""turned on"" person and I have frequently masturbated or wanted to have sex. Within the last year or so it has gotten to the point where it is starting to really bother me and interfere with my life. I have gotten in trouble for viewing porn and I always want to have sex with my girlfriend and react negatively when she says no (not her fault). 

The proper response is to see a therapist, which I am in the process of booking but does anyone else experience this? The thoughts plague me and they don't go away. It's like when ""i take care of it"" the intrusive thoughts go away. You'd think I was a teen or something but I am in my early 30's. 

Am I just a sex addict, is this a function of a type of OCD, or does this relate to my bipolar?

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks"
58282,bipolar,Change my mind: Lithium is safer than antipsychotics.,"Antipsychotics have a higher rate of dangerous side effects than lithium does. In America, weight gain and metabolic syndrome are not considered dangerous side effects because 'murica🇺🇲, but this is a mistake of thinking. 

 Weight gain on lithium is rare, and is a result of hypothyroidism, which can be corrected with synthroid. Kidney disease on lithium is rare if the medication is taken correctly and it can be detected and reversed before it gets serious.

 Extrapyramidial symptoms from antipsychotics are also rare but more common than lithium related kidney disease and in 15% of cases can not be reversed.

Antipsychotics will cause more death and disability in our lifetime than lithium and will also be less effective in controlling bipolar illness than lithium for the average bipolar patient."
58283,bipolar,My family doesn’t understand me !,I recently moved in with my cousin to get away from my toxic ex and I’ve been having a good time and he understands but doesn’t at the same time . He just says im weak minded like im sorry i was strong minded when i 14 to raise myself but then along the way i got tired of trying and made mistakes I didn’t have control over the situation. He is just a cold hearted person and makes me sad he doesn’t understand some of us actually have a mental disease and it affects our life. He thinks i chose to do all those things. When i try saying I don’t chose what i feel he doesn’t get it and says we let ourselves feel that way. Like im sorry you’re able to be normal but I don’t know what normal is . He doesn’t see that his sister has severe depression like she sleeps more than 12 hours and barely does anything. Anyways thats my rant for rn. I always feel some type of way and it makes mad that I just can’t be normal . And sit there and have a conversation without me over sharing or just starting to feel sad because im surrounded by so many people but feel alone at the same time. Also pretty sure my other cousin had ocd cause homie checks things more than twice when clearly things are off . Makes me mad how my cousins go thur similar situation but my older cousin just wants to call us weak minded when at least im trying my best to move on and live life .
58284,bipolar,Ex is taking my daughter (6 y) away from me because of my diagnosis,"We are separated for more than two years. Ever since we equally took care of our daughter. I had two maniac episodes in that time, went to psych ward once and started medication and therapy. My ex has always been fully informed about my diagnosis and therapy. 
Couple of weeks ago she started accusing me that my psychic state is endangering the child. Of course, I had the same concern ever since, but I am actually pretty sure that so far my daughter hardly notices my episodes, let alone has to suffer from them. I am a very caring father and have a very good relationship with my daughter. I manage my episodes for more than 15 years, have good and reliable medication and also know when it’s time to seek help. It’s merely a couple of days per episode that I really can’t take care of my child. I know and notice that and let her stay at my ex then.


I would understand that my daughter was taken away from me if I actually endangered her. But it’s not the case. Consequently, my ex also has no specific complaint or case about me acting improper as a father. She simply argues that I am mentally ill, so she can’t allow me to take care of our daughter anymore. I feel horribly stigmatized. She also threatens to use this argument in court, in case I tried to pursue my rights (and my daughter’s right to also have a father..). I am quite desperate and don’t know how to react. I love my daughter very much and she is an incredibly important part of my life, if not the most important one. Seeing her only every other weekend is not acceptable for me.

I already offered my ex the opportunity to talk to my doctors in order to build trust, but she never accepted it. We are going to mediation for years, but also this does not seem to work anymore. It seems to me that she simply uses my diagnosis as an excuse to take the child.

Does anyone here share a similar experience? Do any of you guys have kids / kids with ex partners? How are you dealing with it?"
58285,bipolar,Currently battling a depressive episode,"I'm really trying to make it through the day but I can hardly take my mind off of suicide. I know all the usual things one says to someone like me and they have always kept me from it so far, I'm just afraid that one day I'll snap.

But there's one thing that bothers me:  i really like going to the wilderness/nature. And while i'm pretty happy while being there , and feel a connection with nature, i notice whenever i return to the city, i become depressed.

It’s been a very stressful several months at work with the COVIDs and all.
We had about 5 weeks where I was working very closely with about 8 people in a very high stakes stressful environment. Working 16+ hour days, with a lot of eyes on our productivity. Clearly, this is going to affect me. I survived it - on lots of coffee - but one day, toward the end of this time period. One of the guys I was working with looks me in the eye and says “Sometimes you’re so on top of things, and sometimes you seem so defeated.” Then with all seriousness he leans in and asks “are you bipolar?”.
He wasn’t kidding, and he’s educated enough to not throw around mental illness lightly.

58297,bipolar,The answer might’ve always just been ovulation,"At least, for egg-carrying women. I was diagnosed a few years ago at around age 20/21, but was always skeptical about it and didn’t take well to any of the pharmaceutical treatments. I was a regular drug user and figured I was triggering most of my own mania and depression. Given some time and a lot of trial and error and data collection, I’ve determined that the singular cause of this ~mental disorder~ (for me) has been my subconscious preparation for and fallout of ovulation. When the common public talks about menstruation, they too often are referring to the period bloodshed, which is a fairly eventless week for me and many other females. PMS is also too broad, describing that entire post-ov week, which is laden with hormones and moods. Something no one had ever seriously asked me to track and consider — that really changed my life — was trying to recognize the exact moment of ovulation. And since I started using pen and paper and mindfulness to understand my cycle as part of my nature, the whole thing has pieced itself together in a crystal clear picture. I would highly recommend just looking into it and studying ones own body if you are the proud owner of a uterus and have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It took months (which is honestly not that long), but now I’ve learned how to enjoy riding the waves by walking away from triggers, or using healthy coping mechanisms after getting triggered (yoga, music, meditation, other arts), and taking advantage of high-energy days to do activities that enrich my life instead of for male-hunting or self-destruction. 

Just to be clear I am not suggesting I know the root cause of anyone else’s bipolar; I am just sharing an experience I wish someone else had shared with me before I labeled myself as mentally ill. You could just be a natural female, in distress from a natural phenomenon that allows for life to go on and on. Your body might be sending you valuable signals in a world designed to convince you to enslave yourself. It can’t ever hurt to get to know yourself and the vessel you live in with greater sensitivity and care."
58299,bipolar,Struggling with changing Meds and the Diagnosis,"Hi, so this is my first post on reddit and the first time talking about my illness on the internet. I think it will be a bit longer and English isn't my first language, but I hope some of you will stay with me, because I feel kind of lonely and helpless today.

So last year a lot in my private life happened. Nothing traumatic, but for me it was a lot. So I couldn't handle my everyday life anymore and visited the university's psychology help programm (i dont know the English term for that) and there they told me that I should get professional help.
I had luck and found a psychotherapist real quick and with the help of the questionnaire she diagnosed me with a depression. 
I was really taken aback by that and it set out quite the emotions. 
So normally I'm more of a rational person, or I see myself as such, and also in school I never had much drama. Mostly my friends came to me for advice and so that I could get their head straight.
And now I was on a emotional rollercoaster myself, I felt like crying a lot, but mostly couldn't. But I was not your typical depressed because I did leave the house - a lot. I got drunk, didn't sleep much, didn't get a hangover and a lot of times I could not feel much if not drunk. I tried drugs the first time in my life, left my partner, got in debt and one night landed in the emergency, because I fell on my chin while drunk which had to get stichted.
I already had made an appointment by a psychiatrist to get meds and my psychotherapist told me that I should tell her all about the asymptotic behaviour to get the right meds. At this time I also once said to her that I thought about having BP - for my studies I read about people with BP and knew a lot of symptoms. But I also thought that I maybe just imagined it because I read so much (you know when you really get invested in something and suddenly you feel a link to it?)
But the appointment was two months in the future and I fell in a hole, no more party, no more asymptotic, just depression.
So  when the appointment was near I was really happy, thinking I would get the right meds and see clear again, but when I was there I didn't tell her about the other behaviour because I just couldn't feel it anymore and was convinced that I really just had a depression.
So I got Ecitalopram and it took me 2 hours after half a pill the get into a hypomania. I got really investet in the colour red, seeing it everywhere, telling everyone about it and I liked to touch a lot of things. And the colours! The heaven was soooo beautiful. But I also wanted to touch a hot plate and do a handstand from my loft bed and things like that. And I poured coffein and sugar into me like my life depended on it, until my psychiatrist told me that i need to control myself or she will sedate me. I also evolved manipulative tendencies.
Took me about 2 weeks and 2 additional appointments at the psychiatrist to get out of it. After that I was 2-3 months without meds with short depression and hypomanic episodes, mostly just 2 days each with some normal episodes.
So few months after that we try Quetiapin, first two week is just sleep. Than one and a half week was sooo good. I had energie and motivation and everything and then I got depressed again. No more up and downs, just down all the way.
So stopping Quetiapin and first I get better again, but with fast, intensive up and downs. Then just down again, but not so deep like with the meds.
So this time I got an antidepressant again - i shall start on sunday, just the quarter of the normal dose and shall immediately stop if my mood gets to high and come see my psychiatrist. If it doesn't help she wants to get me on lithium.

But I'm really afraid now. I am afraid that it doesn't work again, that I will get into  mania again and have to start over, but on the other side I want to get back into a manic episode... And I'm afraid that it ""works"" and I heard the first weeks on a new antidepressant are mostly shit. And I  am still not convinced if I maybe just imagine the whole illness, because I'm really good in controlling my mania, which seems like a thing you shouldn't be able too? The only reason for me to make sense out of it is that I read so much about BP and I knew the symptoms. But this is also the reason why I think would be able to fake it.
I often fear that I just want a lot of attention and an excuse to not be productive, like ""oh look at poor me struggling with a mental Illness"" but on the other hand I hate that attention.
I even don't know what I want from this post, I thought about deleting it a lot while writing, but maybe something good will come out of it..?"
58301,bipolar,Mania helped me leave an abusive relationship,"This happened two months ago. When I met my stbx husband my mental health was the best it’s ever been. The morning after we said the L word I sat him down and explained that I’m bipolar, and what that means. I gave him my fave book on the subject Unquiet Mind by Kay Redfirkd Jameson), showed him the movie Silver Lining bc I felt it was a pretty accurate portrayal of what we go through. He was understanding and supportive. 

Cut to me actually getting depressed about 6 months after our wedding. After a week or so he seemed to be annoyed that I was having such a hard time. I feel like that was when he started to push me away and my depression only got worse.

We went from drinking a glass of wine or having a few beers at home after work to him drinking straight bourbon for three hours. At some point he turned into a mean drunk. Then he just turned mean. So, of course my mental health was out of whack. All the while, I was trying desperately to stay stable so I didn’t provoke his anger. But he was *always* fucking angry with me. He told me my head was the only reason he acted the way I did, that I deserved it when he belittled me. He was straight up emotionally and verbally abusive.  My mood went from depressed to labile and any time I got heated he incited me further so that the fight was my fault, no matter how it started. Then he would pretend there was no fight, he’d text me (I always stayed in our bedroom to avoid him after he yelled at me) and ask if I wanted to watch a movie a few hours after he showered me in insults, like it never happened. I was always too scared of another fight to bring it up. There was a night when he told me that he wouldn’t date me if he met me now bc I’m crazy and I don’t know how to function as an adult. He came to bed and fucked me a few hours later. I was so stunned I just laid there and let him. I was so ashamed. We tried counseling, which did no good since he couldn’t get off his high horse and accept that he was part of the problem. It never got better. And I just... stayed. Then one morning he picked a fight AT 6:45 AM, during which he wrapped his arms around himself in a hug, which is my self soothing move when my breathing becomes irregular, and whined “I’m Bettydelsol and I’m bipolar so I can’t handle my emotions.” Final. Fucking. Straw. I knew I was manic and I knew it was impulsive but I also knew that I HAD TO GET OUT.  So I went to my parent’s house, two days later I contacted a realtor and an attorney. I moved fast bc I knew I might crash, get depressed and go back home. He was stunned. I’m so fucking proud of myself. I’m nervous about my future and sad about being single at 38, but I will never again feel anxious on my way home from work. I will never have to walk on eggshells around my roommate, my loving labrador Lucy. I am leaving a big house in a posh section of our city, a secure financial situation and guaranteed retirement (I’m a preschool teacher and the pay is terrible), a stepdaughter and in laws I adore. And I am happier than I have been in years. 

TLDR; I used my manic impulsivity to get out and stay out of a shitty marriage."

60275,bipolar,Im angry but not suprised,"Hello, for background I am a minor, and my parents are divorced. I always felt odd growing up. i was expelled from the school i went to as a child for reasons unknown to me, and after the severe bullying i received, i was home schooled from the 6th grade and forward. I was, and still am, severely depressed and i hated myself. Since i was young,  i became the perfect model child of the family. my father never punished me and he always praised me for how good i was.  But obviously, it was an act. even my therapist said i was normal, that all my issues were in my head, but i never opened up to anybody

Im not sure why...But one night, i was opening up to my dad about things. I have been trying to talk to him more, about life, and how i feel...Mostly because my mom has been more hateful to me as of late...But he said something. I was talking about how i felt emotions, and how i felt like i could never catch a break. 

He looked at me in the eyes, and he told me as a child i was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. and i guess he just, never told me. My dad is weird in that he doesnt believe in my diagnoses. as a child i was diagnosed with adhd, and he doesnt believe i have it because ""i dont run around that much"".  He did tell me that apparently it runs in the family. He also told me the reason i was expelled from my school as a child was because my parents didnt want to medicate me.

I dont know why he told me now. but it made me extremely angry that he hid it from me for so long. i barely slept that night and the morning after i was so angry that i filled 12 pages with drawing in the span of an hour to cope. But, it wasnt really that surprising.  in fact, it made a lot of sense. it explains a lot to be honest. but its infuriating that i had to suffer for so long, thinking i was different, hiding who i was, just because i didnt get help. My dads going to take me to see a psychiatrist soon per my request, to see if i can get an update on the diagnoses or whatever the fuck, but i guess im one of you guys. 

Thank you for letting me vent."
60276,bipolar,Beginning Lithium!,"Hi everyone. ❤️
This is my first post here so I’ll just start by saying I’m ‘M,’ I’m 21, female and from Aus. I have bipolar and BPD; both recently diagnosed as we spent 6 years thinking it was just depression. 

I am taking 100mg of desvenlaxfine (pristiq) and today am starting to take 450mg of lithium. I was just wondering about other people’s experiences with lithium, side effects, warnings or advice anyone may have. My psychiatrist and therapist have high hopes that this drug will help so I’m cautiously optimistic. 

Thanks in advance and much love!

Edit: I’m a female, just going by the title of ‘M’ as it’s the first letter of my name! Sorry for the confusion."
60277,bipolar,Had to come out at work,Had to come out at work yesterday. I work with toxic chemicals at times and we have to submit to a yearly blood test. Well my blood test had some “anomalies” and a nurse was sent to question me about any drugs I take and redraw a sample. I told her what I take and how much and she looked at me and said “you must be bipolar”. I told her yes and she wrote it down. Now I’m paranoid because my manager gets a copy of that report. I’ve been here 14 months without anyone knowing about my condition. Now upper management will know. I’m freaking out because I don’t want them scrutinizing me and I sure don’t want to lose my job. Is there any way I can do damage control?
60278,bipolar,What's your best meds combo? What's your diagnosis?,I take lithium and carbamazepine. I have bipolar 1 with mixed mood and psychotic features. I also used to have rapid cycling until carbamazepine fixed it. My meds have put my illness in compete remission 🥳
60279,bipolar,advice/tips on managing needed!,"so i’ve been struggling with my mental illnesses for so long and despite going through 13 different meds, doing therapy programs, being inpatient and outpatient multiple times, learning dbt skills, and whatever else these last 4 years,, i’m still at a complete loss and i still have no coping mechanisms getting me through daily life (except abusing substances). 

i sometimes wonder if i even have bipolar because my depressive episodes last for months and months and months and i genuinely don’t think i’ve ever experienced any kind of baseline. i do have hypomanic episodes so its evident that i’m bipolar, but wow my depression can last so long it doesn’t even seem like it. 
i’ve hit rock bottom over and over. it gets really hard when you’re the most incapable person you know because no one understands, even if i’m surrounded by people that are also mentally ill it doesn’t weigh them down like it does for me. they are still able to work and function and act like a normal person, and i’m just not, and i really don’t know why. being 19 and in a household that has never once made me feel cared for or loved also adds to all of this, but i suppose there’s nothing i can do about that for now, since i can’t even hold a job properly. 

when does this ever get easier? does anyone have any advice for someone that has been in a deep dark hole for more than a year? or any advice on how to start being an adult? i’m so ridiculously lost right now and i have been ever since i graduated high school in 2019 and no longer had anything to be alive for..i took a “gap year” because i wanted to get myself to a place where i can actually function; a year has passed and i’m just getting worse and worse, like always. every single year is worse than the last for me. 


i’m so incredibly lost and i just really need some good and genuine advice on how to handle being so depressed and in such a bad place, 24/7, for months. could this just be something that never really gets better and i kinda just have to force myself through regardless, with no hope of ever being happy in sight? i’ve done all of the things that i’ve been told; i’m in therapy, ive been through meds, ive taken care of myself etc and none of it has ever brought any substantial relief, a baseline, or actual growth. i worry that i’m genuinely broken for good. thank you lots to anyone who replies i really need some advice right now 💖"
60280,bipolar,Hospital,"Thinking I might admit myself today. I can’t do it anymore. 

That’s all."
60281,bipolar,I despise that we feel it's necessary to hide it!,"Bipolar really needs to be better destigmatized.  I hate that I and everyone else are so insecure about revealing it at work or to... anyone other than those they trust with their lives.  I long for a day when people will be no more shocked than if you admitted to having a cold but that'll never happen. 
What exactly is it that we feel the need to hide?  I'm guessing it's that so many still misunderstand it and think it means you're homicidal or pose a threat of some kind of harm to others...?  Is it that some of us can reach psychosis?  I will admit I'm not a fan of revealing that aspect to anyone.  No offense to my fellow Bipolar sufferers but you must admit that psychosis is essentially being temporarily crazy to a degree.  But what is ""crazy"" exactly?  It's subjective anyhow!
Ugh... sorry for venting."
60282,bipolar,The future of dating someone with bipolar disorder,"Hello all.

I have been dating a girl for over two years (broke up once) and on paper she is the defect girl for me. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in high school and it has unfortunately affected her and our relationship quite a bit. I have always felt bad about it because it is not her fault that she was diagnosed with it, yet it does affect our relationship. She has had a few suicide attempts and I am overall concerned for the future. While my dad absolutely means well, he believes that people diagnosed with bipolar typically get worse as they grow up and she may be unable to work one day. While I know this is ridiculous and people diagnosed with bipolar can live long fulfilling lives, so much has happened that I am concerned for the future. I do understand this is one sided, and I love her greatly, but is it wrong of me to want to break up due to fears of the future?"
60284,bipolar,Geodon tremors,Has anyone had stiffness and tremors from geodon and did they subside ?
60285,bipolar,Just writing it all out.,"(Friday - August 21 2020)

My wife is in the living room. I'm sitting in my home office.   
I'm contemplating suicide .. again.   
NO i'm not here to promote suicide or ask for help. I'm here to write it all out. 

Let me go back to 2005. I was a straight A student. Everyone around me thought I was smart.  
People thought I had ambitions and goals and dreams.  
My only dream was to leave home and move as far away from it as possible.

Because of my grades, several scholarships were offered to me.   
But I was raised to believe there are only 3 types of people on Earth: Doctors, Engineers, &amp; Failures.

I didn't want engineering. In fact, my desire was to not study at all.  
You see, all my school years were about making my teachers happy. Satisfy them, make them believe I'm actually enjoying their bullshit.   
That's my goal: to make people like me by ensuring I satisfy their image about me.  
My math teachers used to love me because I never had any issues with numbers.   
Numbers never lie.  
In fact, all my teachers liked me. Grown ups seemed to think I'm a smart kid with potential.

I went to college to study accounting and mathematics. I did well for 2 years.  
And then, out of fucking nowhere, I walked into the administration office and I asked them to suspend me. Kick me out of school. I don't want to take exams anymore.   
My sponsors were shocked, and so was the university. I made up some excuse about family issues at home.   
That's the first time I left college (but not the last). 

I went back home, locked myself in my room, avoided interacting with my parents and people in general. I started taking sleeping pills (I've had sleeping issues since I was a child).   
This time I was using sleeping pills to numb my brain. I didn't want to keep hearing the fucking voices in my head that kept yelling: ""Failure! Worthless piece of shit. Ungrateful asshole. You're a worthless piece of shit. Fuck you."" 

Because of my grades in school and my CV, I received another scholarship to study Medicine.    
A chance for a fresh start. The hero's journey is about to begin.   
I will finally be able to make my parents happy. 

And so my Medicine journey began. I got accepted into a great school in Europe. I won't talk about how I lost more than 80lbs (40kgs) in 3 months.   
Let's jump into my first year in medical school.

Here I am. Another shot at satisfying my teachers and the voices in my head. They're saying I'm still a worthless piece of shit. But I tried to ignore.  
Yoga. Exercise. Healthy food. Breathing bullshit. Reading. Etc etc etc ...   
I woke up daily around 5:30am and exercised. I attended my classes and was very active in college.   
In fact, I was so active in my first year that I didn't notice I was pressuring myself.    
But I did great. 

However, the voices in my head kept getting louder and more painful. ""So what you're in medical school? You're nothing but a fucking useless piece of shit. You don't even want medicine. You're a hypocrite"" ... etc etc .. 

I kept moving forward.   
Until I repeated what I did: a couple of years into medical school, I walked into the admin office and asked to be expelled. I had written on the back of an exam paper that I no longer want to live. I'm tired of living. I no longer have energy to fake my interest in anything.  
So I was referred to a psychiatrist and a therapist in 2012. That was the year I was diagnosed with Bipolar.

Honestly? The diagnoses helped explain my fucking mood swings, but the comfort quickly went away.   
I tried various medications, CBT, NLP, blah blah therapy ... but I treated my therapists as teachers: I pretended that their methods were helping to not hurt their feelings.   
In fact, I would feel guilty if I was honest with them. I enjoyed talking to a couple of them.   
They, too, thought I was smart (the more I hear it, the shittier I become). Why? because what's the point of being smart when my brain is fucked. 

But I kept faking everything - my interest in school, my interest in life, the way I interact with people ..  everything external about me was fake. 

And then, in 2015, with 2 years left to get my degree, I left school.  
My brother died. Overdose. He was 7 years older than me, married with one little boy.   
I had to inspect his body in the morgue. I never knew my brother. We were fucking strangers living in the same house.   
He used ti bully me a lot, but I thought it was normal for older brothers to spit and hit their younger brother. Besides, my parents told me I was being a brat for complaining to them about being bullied.  
So I learned to keep my shit to myself (that's my #1 rule). 

I digress. My brother is dead. I left medical school ( and used my brother's death as an excuse). My sponsors couldn't do anything because I was too good at school. My record was clean. I was a good boy. 

Now, I don't have a medical degree. But I have some shitty BSc that I used to work. My sponsors asked me to work while preparing for an MSc. I did what I was told. 

I worked. I did my postgraduate shit. And I kept fucking my mind up.  
Drugs. Binge eating. More drugs. 

And here I am. I married the girl I claimed to love, but our marriage has been awful. We live in different countries, and I haven't seen my kids since 2019 because of Covid19 and because I'm currently broke. 

My entire life savings have been drained by my impulsivity and stupid decisions.   
I have more than $500,000 in debt. I'll remain a slave to the bank until 2026. 

My job required that I carry a handgun sometimes. (they don't know I'm bipolar, otherwise I'd be asked to go home due to my ""disability"". I can't afford being jobless). The gun is right here, sitting on the top shelf next to my desk. I've contemplated using it, but I don't want to fuck up my kids.  
Besides, I know it's not the way to solve my problems. 

I'm not asking for help. I'm just tired of being me.   
I'm 31 without any skills or talents. My friends have moved on with their lives.   
I hate my job. I hate myself for the failures in my life. I hate myself for being a slave to my parents and family and teachers and sponsors and everyone. I am genuinely disgusted with myself.

This is my first post on Reddit. I'm not sure why I wrote it.   
Words are useless. And then what?

I'm sorry for the long post. I'll post it as is without editing.  
I left out details because, well, who gives a fuck.

I have more than 15 notebooks - hand-written and typed - of my journals since I finished school.  
That's right. I have access to my thoughts and feelings and emotions since I was a fucking teen.  
I don't recommend doing it. Having your past with you physically is fucking painful.  
I'm literally carrying my past with me. (move on blah blah. Shut up. go fuck yourself.)

I was diagnosed with Bilateral Avascular Necrosis of the Hip. In other words, both my femur heads are fucked without any reason. I just woke up one day with weird pain in my groin. Then I couldn't walk. Then I was diagnosed. The solution? Joint replacement. Fuck that. 

Blah blah blah. I'm sorry. I'll shut up now. Thank you for not judging me. 

I'm just a lost idiot who is unworthy of anything. I'm a waste of oxygen. Wasted potential.   
I'm only counting the days till I'm not in debt anymore. Maybe then I'll find another excuse to fuck my mood up.

Goodnight."
60287,bipolar,How can I help my wife?,"Background:  
My wife is diagnosed bipolar. She has been doing great for years, and we married a couple of years ago. She changed a medication last summer to something safer for pregnancy, and since then has had issues with anxiety around work, calling out a lot, etc. We finally realized that this all started with the medication switch, and so she's transitioning back to the one that worked well.  Unfortunately, she's called out several times during the probationary period at this new job, including yesterday. I realized this morning that she was likely being fired yesterday if she hadn't called out. I'm half expecting to get a call today that she has been fired, at which point I'll take the rest of the day off to go home with her.   

Question:  
How can I best help her? I've tried to reassure her that financially we'll be able to make it (although very tight), and that in 2-3 weeks when she's fully on the good medication, she'll feel much better. But she obviously isn't doing well currently, and I don't know that that future seems real to her. She isn't having any thoughts of self harm, just hopelessness and guilt, which seem to feed on themselves and make her feel worse. Does anyone have any advice? I've experienced bouts of anxiety and depression personally, but nothing like this and I'm not sure what to do other than be there."
60288,bipolar,What were the circumstances/triggers that led to your first manic episode?,"I recognize that exploring this question might be triggering for some, but for those of you who feel comfortable talking about it what triggered your first manic episode? Curious to hear for both mania and hypomania. Do you feel like their are certain habits and substances that trigger you or add to the momentum or do you feel like regardless of what you do your energy just shifts?  

For me it was weed, caffeine, and a subsequent lack of sleep. Had no idea I had bipolar and wound up in a psych ward for a week with lots of Zyprexa (tons of fun! lol)"
60290,bipolar,Can lithium stop being effective after many years?,"If lithium has worked to reduce or eliminate symptoms for someone for over 10 years, is it possible (or common?) for it to stop working? 

Or if symptoms are becoming unmanageable on the regimen that was sufficient before, does that mean the illness is getting worse? Does bipolar d/o severity progress over time?"
60291,bipolar,Severe arm weakness on Lithium?,"Did it also happen to any of you? How did you deal with it? I doubt I will stop taking it any time soon, as it's helping me a lot mentally. 

It's so bad I have trouble lifting a full glass of water to my mouth or using a keyboard with higher resistance. 

My lithium levels are normal, so are my extended blood test results. I am 26F, normal weight. If you've went through any kind of therapy to ease this and it helped, I'd love to hear about it. 💓"
60292,bipolar,Abilify and too much sleep,"Has anyone here started to sleep much more on Abilify? First days of taking it I slept like 22 hours a day on the weekend. Now even after months of taking it I sleep about 10 hours a night + some more during the day (normally it would be 7-8). It's horrible. So I stopped taking it and now I feel my energy coming back, but it's possible that I'll go into hypomania soon. 10mg makes me sleepy and 5mg doesn't prevent hypomania. Anyone here with the same experience?"
60293,bipolar,I love/need/crave super dangerousely intense feelings,"It's like my brain is looking for ways to thrill as a way to just survive. 

I have to get those dangerous spkies of unhealthy intense feelings to discharge the brain cells of the stress that boredom creates in my fucked up synapses.

It's almost like i need to get to a toxic point and then go supernuts to wash this polluted brain of mine with near death cocktails of various neuro-transmitters.

Does anybody else on here have these super-intense cravings ?"
60294,bipolar,Does Pregabalin also act as a mood stabilizer like Lamictal?,I am curious about this because my mood is unstable and want to find a suitable med for me.
60295,bipolar,Not sure if in daily life anyone trusts me?,"Just need reassurance i’m more than my manic episodes! On medication now, and go to therapy, looking to change it soon. I just feel like people should automatically understand?? Thanks y’all, so glad to have found such a reaffirming and kindhearted community !!"
