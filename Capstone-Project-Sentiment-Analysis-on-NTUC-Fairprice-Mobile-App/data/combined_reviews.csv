2020-09-11 13:47:35,Not a good experience for first timer. Login and sign up was not a problem. What i did not like at all was after entering all details it prompted me no delivery dates are available which should have been the first step instead of last,1,Monish Punekar,googleplay,9,2020,1
2020-07-31 21:04:24,"One of the lousiest app! Tried using it several times since May 20 but never once did I complete the transaction. Reason: 1. In May 20 it always say ""no slot"". By the time there was slot, many items in my cart had become ""no stock"". No point for me to pay the delivery fee for a ""half-filled cart"". 2. In Jul 20 I tried to use the app again to utilise a promo code. But it kept saying ""promo code error"". When the code finally got accepted, some items became ""no stock"" again. It's so irritating!",1,yt ng,googleplay,7,2020,1
2020-09-06 08:10:27,Lousy app. Cannot find most items using brand name. Now they change the use of label scanning in app which totally disable the label function when store not detected. Slow and unstable. Any online grocery app now is far better.,1,Nathanael Lim,googleplay,9,2020,1
2020-06-25 00:07:48,NEW : GETS BETTER AND BETTER - MY LISTS DON'T WORK NOW - how to shop? OLD: this app has improved significantly over the last 2+year. It still is missing the AI to anticipate what you want to order and to. give quick access to your shopping list and. allow you to sort and filter your favourites / shopping list ... This makes the app. very inefficient and slow to shop in.. And product wise - consistently rotten fruit and vegetables,1,A Google user,googleplay,6,2020,1
2020-07-19 12:43:30,The app would have gotten a 4 stars from me except the fact that it is not thought thru well enough as all purchases thru this app are not eligible for the bonus points that consumers need for redemption.

2020-08-06 15:13:41,"All the complaints by other users also happened to me. I even email to them but nothing rectified.

2020-05-30 10:06:23,"Techical bugs need to be fixed, e.g. 'invalid cart'. Should not auto-remove our item if it's out of stock. Why not just disable the check-out function for the item while maintaining it at the cart? I have been using this app for more than 3 years. Before the CB, things work fine. During the CB, i can see that other platforms are catching up and improving their app, now working much better than this app. FairPrice Online instead is lagging behind and losing the #1 choice reputation.",1,Rou Shen Liew,googleplay,5,2020,1

2020-09-08 13:59:43,"I have shifted to Red mart and PrimeNow for some time due to bad experience. Thought to give it a try again, but experience is still bad. Always no stock on very basic items and limited selections that is far far less than the physical store. Eg. fresh seafood, pork...even don't have regular tomatoes. Worst, the order is almost always amended to remove a few items due to no stock. This creates problem as the main ingredient for a dish is gone.The inventory system is certainly broken.",1,Tan PK,googleplay,9,2020,1
2020-04-06 00:17:20,"I don't know how this app was on normal times, but in this high demand time, exactly at midnight the cart never loads, and after every few minutes it says my cart is empty. Failed Load Test Miserably",1,Rajasekhar Tatavarthi,googleplay,4,2020,1

2019-10-03 21:53:14,"The upgrade slows down everything. Why ask for delivery address first? I prefer the older app which asks for address after order is confirmed and paid. Special offers highlighted in red shows only 1 line of text, which means I have to click on it to read what the special offer is. Slows things down. Imagine having to click on the red text for all the items you're ordering. The search engine is also not smart and intuitive. I don't feel like ordering.",1,Luan Yee,googleplay,10,2019,1

Now, I am prevented from buying many items, especially the bulky items, because the store that is tagged to my address is a smaller one and doesn't carry most of the items I am looking for.

2019-11-10 22:21:54,"Easy to use. However, limited products available, and some out of stock. This lead to having the need to purchase the products directly from the mart.

Today,  email and text message show my order is on the way.   After a Long wait, I called and found out my order had been cancelled due to some technical issue.   Nobody in Fairprice bother to call and inform.  I had been waiting for the order as one of the item I ordered urgently need to used.    Only a simply apologise and ask me to order again and they can only deliver the earliest that is next Monday!

It also doesn‚Äôt carry all the different categories of offers that are in the Straits Times, and these used to be in the old design of the app. I searched the entire newly designed app and can‚Äôt find the followings, which were obvious to users in the old design: 

1st: Deepavali Specials - the items listed under ‚ÄúDeepavali Draw‚Äù in the new design are NOT the same as those advertised in the Straits Times. Previously, they were the same and there was a clear and obvious designed category ‚ÄúDeepavali Specials‚Äù that I could click on to get the full list of items on offer.

2nd: 3-day Weekend Offers: This is not listed at all today in the new design. In the old design of the app, it was uploaded every Friday, to sync with the newspaper advertisement. Plus, users only needed to click ‚Äú3-day Weekend Offers‚Äù to see all items on offer in this category in the old design.

3rd: Brands Offers: The old design was so easy and intuitive to use - just a click on the freebies from the different brands, users would see the various items of that specific brand to buy. Now, users only see the freebie & statement like ‚ÄúFree pan with $60 purchase‚Äù. Click it, users only see the free pan!

After spending a long time browsing and finalising my list without the chicken (I usually need to order 4-6 chickens) means I either had to give up my order or order part from here then go to another site to order the chickens.

Called customer service only to be told to wait for 15-20mins. However when its passed 20mins, every time i called, they give the same instructions to wait for another 15 minutes. In the end i waited for more than 2 hours. 

It is not honest and causes disadvantages to people to tell someone to wait for 15 minutes, only for the delivery to come 2 hour later. I can not go anywhere, if i knows it will be more than 2 hours late, i will finish my other tasks first.

The customer service is not reliable in servicing customer.

The driver on the other hand, called my husband that he will arrive 5-7 minutes. But 20 minutes later, the driver is not here yet. I called the driver, but no explanation is given and it seems like the driver is clueless with the location of our place, despite this is our 3rd time ordering from fairprice online, and my place is just beside mrt.

2018-04-11 15:42:14,"Display is not as good as Redmart Very happy to finally buy fr ntuc online however still more improvements needed. 

1) Sale price after discount not shown. Only amount of discount shown so customer have to calculate how much is the final price and if it is worth it. Redmart shows final price upfront! So smart for the shopper to decide!

2) Photos are so tiny! Please see and compare Redmart.

3) Product Title so long that you can‚Äôt see unless you click each item! So you have to guess which flavour you want click and see if you got the right box!  Please learn from Redmart.

4) So many different sub categories of sale items and deals going on. And always sold out when you check out. Arggh irritating.

5) Delivery cost is too high. Again compare Redmart to stay competitive. And why if we opt for pick up, the rebate $3 is only for next purchase? $3 doesn‚Äôt even cover carpark costs, I mean seriously... 

6) Your FOC delivery min is so high and otherwise it‚Äôs $7. Why would anyone buy from you based on that if Redmart gives foc delivery min $40, otherwise $4.99 delv cost?

All the new features could not make up for the frustration.

What is outrageous is that their app still shows that they have the same kind of milo in stock. They refuse to change it for me and claimed it was out of stock. 

What is ridiculous is that their online warehouse operates on a different system then the retail stores. They ask me to call up each and every fairprice outlet to ask if they have the milo. They were not sincere in their apology and made me do their dirty work when it is their poor unprofessional mistake. I mean how hard is it to obtain 36 packets of milo??

2020-07-29 12:59:28,"Legit complaints from a frequent shopper I really hope NTUC succeeds in its foray into the digital space so hear me out here. 

1. Bad UX

- i can search when I‚Äôm not signed in, and when I want to add to my cart I have to sign in which is fair. But when I do, the stuff that I saw that was available is suddenly unavailable. For example, Pampers Premium Care.

- search results are not sorted according to type or relevance! Which is the bare minimum of an e-commerce app. For example, when I search for rice noodles, the first five results are rice noodles or noodles then a trickle of irrelevant products then rice noodles appearing then irrelevant products then rice noodles etc. Why??

- some search results are not relevant! when I search for ‚Äúrice noodles‚Äù I am shown tomato paste, olive oil, canola oil, virgin coconut oil, mustard dressing etc. Why???

- after search results are displayed I have to scroll upwards manually to view starting from top to bottom. Why doesn‚Äôt it display from the top results?

- can you please place all the unavailable items towards the bottom of the search results instead of weaving them intermittently within the available items?

2. Bad fulfilment

The delivery service is really superb. On time, and within the same day of ordering even. However, I refrain from ordering fresh items like chicken or vegetables after a couple times bad experience where I was allocated stale chicken and very old vegetables. To be fair, Sheng Siong and RedMart both do poorly on this category. So should NTUC treat this gap as a major opportunity to outshine your competitors?

3. Bad inventory management

About 50% of the time, my confirmed orders are updated to exclude a couple of items that are not available.

100% of the time, many items that I want to buy aren‚Äôt available. I‚Äôm hard pressed to fill my cart of items worth $79 because so many items are unavailable!",1,Leahpenelope,appstore,7,2020,1

Appreciate if u could advise your cashiers that there is no need for them to demand its customers to produce a silver card for the seniors discount on Tuesday when the customer produces her pioneer generation card to show proof. 
I just shopped at Ntuc fp at Nuh medical center and bought a packet of sea salt. The cashier named Monica victor insisted that I must show the silver card for the pioneer discount even when I showed my PG card. She said the pg card is valid only on Monday n Thursday whilst the silver card is valid on Tuesday

I explained to her that the pg card means the holder is already past the senior age and should be valid for the senior discount. Eventually I showed her my IC to prove my age is higher than the senior age

I also told her that in my frequent shopping at Ntuc all over spore, she is the first one who insists on seeing a silver card before granting the senior discount

Pls advise her that the ruling she used is rather ridiculous n obsolete n she needs to know that the pg card holder is past the senior age",5,Pioneer generation member,appstore,6,2017,0

2018-06-22 00:26:59,Checkout problems The app hangs each time I try to enter a promo code. Ended up using the website to complete my order.,2,Lenaid,appstore,6,2018,1
2018-05-30 08:43:32,"Not user friendly Cannot take login details from copy and paste manner. App keeps freezing when applying promo code, luckily items in cart are still intact.

2018-05-22 11:50:55,"Very buggy While I‚Äôm happy that fairprice finally got their act together and launched an app but this app was so buggy and loading was slow. 

Payment page - it saved my CC details for future order as per my request but the disclaimer was that the CVV code would not be saved. That‚Äôs not true at all because mine got saved and at one point it kept pinging my credit card 7x for OTP!!

Please fix this otherwise you guys are really gonna lose out to redmart which is where most people have been shopping via the app.",1,Booboo80,appstore,5,2018,1

2018-04-15 14:46:31,"Very lousy app.... Not user friendly. It can‚Äôt save the username & password so I need to log in by keying password again and again whenever I make a purchase. Slow slow slow.... RedMart is so much better. Hello Fairprice, you need to check the app again.",1,Xlo Juan,appstore,4,2018,1
2018-03-30 16:22:57,Big room to improve The UI UX is far behind similar competitors like RedMart amazon prime. Navigation is not opmtimized and Check our process is very confusing.,2,firemonkeysg,appstore,3,2018,1
2018-03-30 05:32:02,"Definitely needs rework App does not rotate in iOS especially on iPads.
Payment interface does not seem to work like other iOS apps where credit card data is auto filled.
App hung a few times, all ordering data lost had to reselect.
Of the three apps I use Amazon  Prime, Redmart and Fairprice I have to put this app a distant third.
If only the app were easier and more reliable, your competitors would be in trouble.",1,Rozariom,appstore,3,2018,1
2018-03-30 03:54:15,Unstable The app is unstable. Hangs many occasions. Loading rather slow. There are bugs need to be fix. Unable to key in first time promo code. Was asked to enter from wish list to cart and only then the code worked. Please remove the pop up above the screen which keep sliding down telling us about the promotion ‚Äúpurchase with purchase‚Äù. They are annoying. Please fix them. Other than that I would love to do Fairprice online for its convenience.,2,Shoopeeemart,appstore,3,2018,1
2018-02-11 02:05:41,"It‚Äôs not worth a star - But I give one to send this review 1) Log in details is frustrating. Each time I close the app I get logged out and it does not ‚Äòremember‚Äô me, the user.
2) Once the OTP sms is received the app closes and I got logged out again and have to start the checkout process all over again. You need 2 phones to complete the process ‚Äî One to check for OTP and one to key in Credit Card details.

Complete frustration.",1,ItTakesForever,appstore,2,2018,1
2018-02-06 22:26:49,"Buggy As Hell! Useless app! Tried to check out. First, I couldn‚Äôt proceed to choose delivery slots, then couldn‚Äôt process payment because there was no place to enter the OTP code from the bank! What can I say? Useless!",1,gambit_69,appstore,2,2018,1
2017-09-18 02:36:21,"Disappointed I tried a few apps and only NTUC app carries the brand of item I wanted which made me happy. I choose my stuff, put everything in the Cart. I keyed in my postal code when I was about to checkout, it turned out the my postal code is invalid (I tried a few times to make sure it wasn't a typo).. really...? C'mon, my ""new"" flat has already been up to more than 2 years.. it can't be that new till your system can't find my house? I deleted my app already. Thanks.",2,Himekoori,appstore,9,2017,1

2016-09-21 10:06:04,"Lag Using an iPhone 6, but app is rather lag, takes a good 10 seconds just to delete or refresh an item. Also need to key in credit card details (if you choose not to save it) before one can see if discount is being applied when using promo code. Otherwise alright.",2,Pink Flying Pig,appstore,9,2016,1
2016-01-04 09:10:08,"Need serious debugging 1 - Total price does not match up
2 - item goes out of stock after I remove from cart
3 - discount code given for first time users expired even before using
4 - discount code not displayed on checkout",1,iBur,appstore,1,2016,1
