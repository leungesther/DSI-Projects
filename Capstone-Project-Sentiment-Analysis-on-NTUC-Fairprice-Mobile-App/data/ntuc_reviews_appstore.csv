It is not honest and causes disadvantages to people to tell someone to wait for 15 minutes, only for the delivery to come 2 hour later. I can not go anywhere, if i knows it will be more than 2 hours late, i will finish my other tasks first.

The customer service is not reliable in servicing customer.

The driver on the other hand, called my husband that he will arrive 5-7 minutes. But 20 minutes later, the driver is not here yet.

1) Sale price after discount not shown. Only amount of discount shown so customer have to calculate how much is the final price and if it is worth it. Redmart shows final price upfront! So smart for the shopper to decide!

2) Photos are so tiny! Please see and compare Redmart.

3) Product Title so long that you can‚Äôt see unless you click each item! So you have to guess which flavour you want click and see if you got the right box!  Please learn from Redmart.

4) So many different sub categories of sale items and deals going on. And always sold out when you check out. Arggh irritating.

5) Delivery cost is too high. Again compare Redmart to stay competitive. And why if we opt for pick up, the rebate $3 is only for next purchase? $3 doesn‚Äôt even cover carpark costs, I mean seriously... 

6) Your FOC delivery min is so high and otherwise it‚Äôs $7. Why would anyone buy from you based on that if Redmart gives foc delivery min $40, otherwise $4.99 delv cost?

False,,Legit complaints from a frequent shopper,2020-07-29 12:59:28,"I really hope NTUC succeeds in its foray into the digital space so hear me out here. 

1. Bad UX

- i can search when I‚Äôm not signed in, and when I want to add to my cart I have to sign in which is fair. But when I do, the stuff that I saw that was available is suddenly unavailable. For example, Pampers Premium Care.

- search results are not sorted according to type or relevance! Which is the bare minimum of an e-commerce app. For example, when I search for rice noodles, the first five results are rice noodles or noodles then a trickle of irrelevant products then rice noodles appearing then irrelevant products then rice noodles etc. Why??

- some search results are not relevant! when I search for ‚Äúrice noodles‚Äù I am shown tomato paste, olive oil, canola oil, virgin coconut oil, mustard dressing etc. Why???

- after search results are displayed I have to scroll upwards manually to view starting from top to bottom. Why doesn‚Äôt it display from the top results?

- can you please place all the unavailable items towards the bottom of the search results instead of weaving them intermittently within the available items?

2. Bad fulfilment

The delivery service is really superb. On time, and within the same day of ordering even. However, I refrain from ordering fresh items like chicken or vegetables after a couple times bad experience where I was allocated stale chicken and very old vegetables. To be fair, Sheng Siong and RedMart both do poorly on this category. So should NTUC treat this gap as a major opportunity to outshine your competitors?

3. Bad inventory management

About 50% of the time, my confirmed orders are updated to exclude a couple of items that are not available.

100% of the time, many items that I want to buy aren‚Äôt available. I‚Äôm hard pressed to fill my cart of items worth $79 because so many items are unavailable!",1,Leahpenelope

Appreciate if u could advise your cashiers that there is no need for them to demand its customers to produce a silver card for the seniors discount on Tuesday when the customer produces her pioneer generation card to show proof. 
I just shopped at Ntuc fp at Nuh medical center and bought a packet of sea salt. The cashier named Monica victor insisted that I must show the silver card for the pioneer discount even when I showed my PG card. She said the pg card is valid only on Monday n Thursday whilst the silver card is valid on Tuesday

I explained to her that the pg card means the holder is already past the senior age and should be valid for the senior discount. Eventually I showed her my IC to prove my age is higher than the senior age

I also told her that in my frequent shopping at Ntuc all over spore, she is the first one who insists on seeing a silver card before granting the senior discount

Pls advise her that the ruling she used is rather ridiculous n obsolete n she needs to know that the pg card holder is past the senior age",5,Pioneer generation member
